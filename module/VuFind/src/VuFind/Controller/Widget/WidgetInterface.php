 * Widget interface definition.

 * A Widget is a special type of controller plugin comparable to a web portal
 * Portlet. It is a self-contained application component that is interacted
 * and interacts with the main application. The key feature of a Widget is its
 * capability to represent its internal state as a set of query parameters.
 *
 * This interface only defines the basic methods to set and get the widget
 * state.
