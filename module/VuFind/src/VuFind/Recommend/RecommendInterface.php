/**
 * Search Recommendations Interface
 *
 * This interface class is the definition of the required methods for
 * generating search recommendations.
 *
 * Note that every class implementing this interface needs to be accompanied by
 * a template file in the Recommend subdirectory of every theme's template
 * directory.  For example, \VuFind\Recommend\SideFacets needs a corresponding
 * Recommend/SideFacets.phtml template.  The template will be rendered as a
 * partial with two available variables: recommend (the recommendation object)
 * and results (the search results object).
