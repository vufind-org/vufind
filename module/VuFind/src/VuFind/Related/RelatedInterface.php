/**
 * Related Records Interface
 *
 * This interface class is the definition of the required methods for
 * generating record recommendations.
 *
 * Note that every class implementing this interface needs to be accompanied by
 * a template file in the Related subdirectory of every theme's template
 * directory.  For example, \VuFind\Related\Similar needs a corresponding
 * Related/Similar.phtml template.  The template will be rendered as a
 * partial with two available variables: related (the related records object)
 * and driver (the record driver representing the source record).
