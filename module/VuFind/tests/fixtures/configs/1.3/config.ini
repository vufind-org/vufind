;
; VuFind currently supports four logging levels: alert (severe fatal error),
; error (fatal error), notice (non-fatal warning) and debug (informational).
;
; Each logging level can be further broken down into five levels of verbosity.
; You can specify the desired level by adding a dash and a number after the
; level in the configuration string -- for example, alert-2 or error-5.
; The higher the number, the more detailed the logging messages.  If verbosity
; is not specified, it defaults to 1 (least detailed).
;
; Several logging methods are available, and each may be configured to log any
; combination of levels.
;
; You may enable multiple logging mechanisms if you want -- in fact, it is
; recommended, since the failure of one logging mechanism (i.e. database down,
; file system full) may then be reported to another.
;
; If database is uncommented, messages will be logged to the named MySQL table.
; The table can be created with this SQL statement:
; CREATE TABLE log_table ( id INT NOT NULL, logtime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
;     ident CHAR(16) NOT NULL, priority INT NOT NULL, message TEXT,
;     PRIMARY KEY (id) );
;
; If file is uncommented, messages will be logged to the named file.  Be sure
; that Apache has permission to write to the specified file!
;
; If email is uncommented, messages will be sent to the provided email address.
; Be careful with this setting: a flood of errors can easily bog down your mail
; server!

; This section controls how item status information is presented in search results.
[Item_Status]
; Usually, there is only one location or call number for each item; however, when
; multiple values are found, there are several possible behaviors:
;     first = display the first value found, ignore the rest
;     all   = show all of the values found, separated by commas
;     msg   = show a message like "Multiple Call Numbers" or "Multiple Locations"
;     group = show availability statuses for each location on a separate line,
;             followed by callnumber information (valid for multiple_locations only)
multiple_call_nos = first

; You can customize the way each item's status is display in AJAX/status-full.tpl

; You can enable this setting to show links to related MARC records using certain
; 7XX fields.  Just enter a comma-separated list of the MARC fields that you wish
; to make use of.  This relies on subfield w containing either a reference to a bib
; number or an OCLC number prefixed by (OCoLC).  Do not enable this option if your
; data is unable to support it!  Also note that turning on the 780 and 785 fields
; may result in redundant information in the display, since the Solr title_old and
; title_new fields are likely to contain the same information.
