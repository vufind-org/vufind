; order of these settings will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.
;
; Note: The search type of "tag" is a special case that gets handled differently
;       because tags are not stored in the same index as everything else.  Treat

; Values on the left of the equal sign are either the reserved term "relevance"
; or the name of a Solr index to use for sorting; asc and desc modifiers may be
; used in combination with index names, but not relevance.  To allow secondary
; sorting, you may include a comma-separated list of options (for example,
; "year desc,title asc"), but this list may NOT include the special "relevance"
; value.  Values on the right of the equal sign are text that will be run
; through the translation module and displayed on screen.
;
; Note: "year", "author" and "title" are special shortcut aliases for the
;       "publishDateSort", "authorStr" and "title_sort" Solr fields; you can use
;       either form in this file.

; This section allows you to specify the default sort order for specific types of
; searches.  Each key in this section should correspond with a key in the
; [Basic_Searches] section above.  Each value should correspond with a key in the
; [Sorting] section above.  Any search type that is not listed here will be sorted
; using the default_sort setting in the [General] section above.
[DefaultSortingByType]
CallNumber = callnumber

; Each search type defined in searchspecs.yaml can have one or more "recommendations
; modules" associated with it in the following sections.  These plug-ins will cause
; boxes of suggestions to appear beside (in [SideRecommendations]) or above (in
; [TopRecommendations]) the search results.  The special [NoResultsRecommendations]
; are only displayed for empty search results.  You can repeat the line to display a
; series of recommendations boxes in a particular section -- just be sure to include
; brackets ("[]") after the search type name.  If you do not want recommendations
; for a particular search type, set the value to "false" in either or both sections.
; Any search types not listed here will use the default value -- see the
; default_top_recommend and default_side_recommend settings in the [General]
; section above.  It is legal to set the default options to false if you want no
; default value.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the side area:
;
; CatalogResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display catalog search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).  This is designed for use with non-catalog modules.
; EuropeanaResults:[url]:[requestParam]:[limit]:[unwanted data providers]
;       Display search results from Europeana.eu API. [url] is the base search URL
;       default "api.europeana.eu/api/opensearch.rss" [requestParam] parameter name
;       for passing lookup value in url, default is "searchTerms" [limit] defaults to
;       5, is the number of result items to display [unwanted data providers] comma
;       separated list of dataproviders to ignore results from; useful for excluding
;       own results that are also in Europeana. An API key must be set in config.ini
;       (see europeanaAPI setting in [Content] section).
; EuropeanaResultsDeferred: [url]:[requestParam][limit]:[unwanted data providers]
;       See EuropeanaResults, but this version uses AJAX.
; ExpandFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."  Rather than using
;       facets to limit the existing search, this module uses them to start a new
;       search showing all records matching the selected facet value.
; FacetCloud:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Same functionality as ExpandFacets, but with a more compact interface to
;       allow the display of more values.
; OpenLibrarySubjects:[GET parameter]:[limit]:[date filter]:[Subject types]
;       Display full-text, public scans from the Open Library (OL) Subjects API.
;       [GET parameter] (default = "lookfor"), [limit] (default = 5),
;       [date filter] The name of a date filter (from facet settings) to apply to
;           searches.  Defaults to "publishDate" if blank; set to "false" to disable.
;       [Subject types] (default = "topic") comma-separated list of subject types to
;           test. Open Library distinguishes between the following subject types:
;           topic,place,person,time
;       Note: an API call will be made for each type until valid data is returned
;           which will slow down the loading of the main VuFind result set,
;           see OpenLibrarySubjectsDeferred
; OpenLibrarySubjectsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[limit]:[date filter]:[Subject types]
;       The same as OpenLibrarySubjects but uses AJAX to make the API calls after the
;           main result set has loaded
; SideFacets:[regular facet section]:[checkbox facet section]:[ini name]
;       Display the specified facets, where [ini name] is the name of an ini file
;       in web/conf (defaults to "facets" if not supplied), [regular facet section]
;       is the name of a section of the ini file containing standard facet settings
;       (defaults to "Results" if not specified), and [checkbox facet section] is
;       the name of a section of the ini file containing checkbox facet settings
;       (leave blank for no checkbox facets).
; SummonDatabases:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated database recommendations matching the terms found
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; SummonResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display Summon search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the top area:
;
; AuthorFacets
;       Display author names based on the search term.
; AuthorityRecommend:[field1]:[query1]:[field2]:[query2]:...:[field-n]:[query-n]
;       Displays see and see also results to user based on search of Authority Index.
;       Any number of filter queries may be specified as parameters to limit which
;       set of authority records is used for recommendations; for example:
;           AuthorityRecommend:record_type:Heading* OR Topical*:source:LCNAF
;       limits record_type to strings starting with "Heading" or "Topical" and
;       limits source to LCNAF.  Filtering is optional.
; PubDateVisAjax:[zooming]:[facet field 1]:[facet field 2]:...:[facet field n]
;       Display a visualization of publication dates for each of the specified facet
;       fields.  This is designed for a field containing four-digit years.  Only the
;       blueprint theme supports multiple facet field selection, but classic and
;       default work correctly if you render just one field (the most common
;       scenario). Zooming is set to either true or false and controls whether or
;       not selecting part of the graph zooms in to greater detail.
; ResultGoogleMapAjax:[facets]
;       Show a Google Map with markers for all result items which have long/latitude
;       data (be sure to turn on location indexing in import/marc_local.properties).
;       Each marker will show the number of items which are in the long_lat
;       facet. A separate call is made when a marker is clicked to retrieve the
;       first 5 records on that location facet. The map uses clustering to
;       combine markers where there are more than one marker close together into
;       clusters. The facets parameter is the name of the extra config file which
;       holds the facet information(default "facets.ini").
; TopFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."
; WorldCatIdentities
;       Use the WorldCat Identities API to find names and related subjects based
;       on the current search.
; WorldCatTerms:[vocabulary]
;       Use the WorldCat Terminologies API to find Library of Congress Subject
;       Headings related to the current search.  [vocabulary] is the vocabulary to
;       use for recommendations; default is "lcsh" but other options include "fast",
;       "mesh", etc.  See http://tspilot.oclc.org/resources/ for details.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the "no results" area:
;
; SwitchType:[field]:[field description]
;       If the current search type is not the same as [field], display a link
;       suggesting that the user try switching to [field].  [field description]
;       is the human-readable description of [field].  Default values are
;       'AllFields' and 'All Fields' respectively.
;
; You can build your own recommendations modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/development:plugins:recommendation_modules

; This section controls the "New Items" search.
[NewItem]
; Comma-separated list of date ranges to offer to the user (i.e. 1,5,30 = one day
; old, or five days old, or thirty days old).  Be careful about raising the maximum
; age too high -- searching very long date ranges may put a load on your ILS.
ranges = 1,5,30
; This setting controls the maximum number of pages of results that will show up
; when doing a new item search.  It is necessary to limit the number of results to
; avoid getting a "too many boolean clauses" error from the Solr index (see notes
; at https://vufind.org/jira/browse/VUFIND-128 for more details).  However, if you
; set the value too low, you may get the same results no matter which range setting
; is selected!
result_pages = 10
; This setting can be used to automatically apply filter queries to the New Item
; results.  For example, you might want to filter out certain content types.  You
; can add multiple filters by repeating the "filter[] =" line, or you can skip
; filtering entirely by leaving the line commented out.
; filter[] = "format:Book"

; This section controls RSS feed behavior
[RSS]
; If set, this setting will override sort settings associated with RSS feeds.  This
; allows you to ensure that newly added or changed items in your index appear at
; the top of the feed.  Use "first_indexed desc" if you only want newly-added items
; to be listed first.  Use "last_indexed desc" if you want newly-added-or-changed
; items.  Comment out the whole setting if you do not want custom RSS sorting.
; IMPORTANT: In order for first_indexed and last_indexed sorting to work properly,
;            you need to index record change dates; see the Wiki page at
;            https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:tracking_record_changes
sort = "last_indexed desc"

; The following two sections control the behavior of the autocomplete drop-downs
; associated with search boxes.  The [Autocomplete] section contains global default
; settings, while the [Autocomplete_Types] section allows you to associate different
; autocomplete handlers with different search handlers.
;
; The available autocomplete handlers are:
;
; NoAutocomplete
;       Do not provide any suggestions.  You should use this handler if you want to
;       disable suggestions for one search type while still providing suggestions
;       for other search types.  To disable suggestions completely, it is better to
;       use the "enabled" setting in the [Autocomplete] section.
; SolrAuthAutocomplete:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       See SolrAutocomplete below -- this handler behaves exactly the same, except
;       it uses the Solr authority data index rather than the bibliographic index,
;       and its default [Display Field] value is "heading".
; SolrAutocomplete:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       Perform a wildcarded search against [Search Handler], using the contents of
;       [Display Field] (a comma-separated, priority-ordered field list) as
;       suggestions and sorting by [Sort Field].  Any additional parameters at the
;       end of the string are treated as an alternating sequence of field names and
;       values for use as filters against the suggestion list.  All parameters are
;       optional.  If omitted, [Search Handler] will use the default Solr field,
;       [Display Field] will use "title", [Sort Field] will use relevance and no
;       filters will be applied.
; SolrCNAutocomplete
;       A customized version of SolrAutocomplete designed for smart handling of
;       call numbers using the custom CallNumber search handler.
; TagAutocomplete
;       Provide suggestions from the local database of tags.
;
; You can build your own autocomplete modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/configuration:autocomplete

; When snippets are enabled, this section can be used to display captions based on
; the Solr fields from which the snippets were obtained.  Keys are the names of Solr
; fields and values are strings to display to the user.  Note that all displayed
; strings are subject to translation and should be accounted for in the language
; files found in web/lang if you are in a multilingual environment.  Fields that are

; Fields must be stripped if you have a field in your main index which is missing
; from any index includable by shards.  This section can be ignored if you are
; not using sharding or if all of your shards have identical schemas.
;
; Put in the fields to strip here in the following format:

; This section allows for adding hidden filters. Each filter will be translated
; to format 'key:"value"' and added by Solr.php as a hidden filter (a facet that
; is always applied but is not seen by the user).  This is useful if you use a
; shared Solr index and need to display different subsets in different contexts
; (for example, a union catalog with separate VuFind instances each member).
[HiddenFilters]
;institution = "MyInstitution"

; This section is an alternative to [HiddenFilters] when you need to create more
