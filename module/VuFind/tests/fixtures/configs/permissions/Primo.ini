; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
; For PrimoCentral API documentation:
; http://www.exlibrisgroup.org/display/PrimoOI/Brief+Search
; Note: you will need your EL Commons credentials to access documentation
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be
; recognized regardless of case.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; HTTP timeout
timeout = 30

; Your API id (use "mlplus" if using Metalib Plus instead of Primo Central)
apiId = my-id

; The port to use when connecting to the API (normally 1701 for Primo Central, 80
; for Metalib Plus)
port = 1701

; This section controls the result limit options for search results. default_limit
; sets the default number of results per page. limit_options is a comma-separated
; list of numbers to be presented to the end-user. If only one limit is required,
; set default_limit and leave limit_options commented out.
; WARNING: using large limits may require you to raise your PHP memory limits to
; avoid errors.
default_limit        = 20
;limit_options        = 10,20,40,60,80,100

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;default_top_recommend[] = TopFacets:FacetsTop:Primo
default_side_recommend[] = SideFacets:Facets:CheckboxFacets:Primo

; This section is used to set general parameters for URL generation to make a call to the Primo API
bulkSize = 20

; When you filter a search using facets, VuFind will present a checkbox that can
; be used to apply those filters to the next search you perform.  This setting
; controls its default state: on (true) or off (false).
retain_filters_by_default = true

; The filters listed below will be applied to all new searches by default. Omit
; this setting to have no default filters applied. These differ from hidden
; filters because they are visible in the UI and may be removed by the user.
;default_filters[] = "rtype:Books"

; Primo has a fixed cap on how many results you can page through.  Even though
; it may report more results than this number, you can't actually access results
; past the limit.  This setting tells VuFind where to cut off its paging mechanism.
result_limit = 2000

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; Primo as they do in the regular Search module.
[SideRecommendations]
; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.
;[TopRecommendations]
; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.

; This section is used to identify facets for special treatment by the SideFacets
; recommendations module.
[SpecialFacets]
; Any fields listed below will be treated as date ranges rather than plain facets:
dateRange[] = creationdate

; The order of display is as shown below
; The name of the index field is on the left
; The display name of the field is on the right

; Top facets (not used by default)

; pcAvailability is a special facet. It's used to show all records found in

; These settings affect the way facets are displayed on the advanced screen
[Advanced_Facet_Settings]
; Some special facets for advanced searching can be turned on by inclusion in
; the comma-separated list below, or turned off by being excluded.  Currently,
; just one values is supported: "daterange" for the publication year range
; control.

; Any facets named in the list below will have their values run through the
; translation code; unlisted facets will displayed as-is without translation. For
; translated facets, be sure that all of the necessary strings are included in the
; language files found in the languages directory. You may add a colon and the
; name of a text domain after the field name to specify translations in a specific
; text domain (subdirectory of the languages folder). By default, no facets are
; translated -- uncomment or add lines below to turn on this feature.

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of Primo pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with an
; index defined in the Primo API.  The value of each setting is the text to
; display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run through the translator, so
; be sure to update language files if necessary.  The order of these settings
; will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.
