; IMPORTANT NOTE: By default, VuFind will not show any search results that
; require "authenticated" status for visibility. Please configure the
; access.SummonExtendedResults permission in permissions.ini to allow users to

; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; This setting controls the sort order to be used for empty search when relevance
; sort is selected. Since relevance doesn't have a meaningful function with an empty
; search, this can be set to e.g. "PublicationDate:desc".
;empty_search_relevance_override = "PublicationDate:desc"

; This setting controls the default view for search results; the selected option
; should be one of the options present in the [Views] section below.
default_view         = list

; This section controls the result limit options for search results. default_limit
; sets the default number of results per page. limit_options is a comma-separated
; list of numbers to be presented to the end-user. If only one limit is required,
; set default_limit and leave limit_options commented out.
; WARNING: using large limits may cause problems due to a variety of limitations,
; especially if you support bulk operations (which can cause large URLs/requests).
; If you must support large page sizes, you may need to raise the PHP memory_limit
; and max_input_vars settings and/or adjust the Apache LimitRequestLine setting.
default_limit        = 20
;limit_options        = 10,20,40,60,80,100

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be
; recognized regardless of case.  If set to a comma-separated list of operators
; (e.g. "AND,NOT") then only the listed operators will be case-sensitive.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations], [SideRecommendations] or

; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use Summon database recommendations at the

; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
