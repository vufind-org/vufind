; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; This setting controls the sort order to be used for empty search when relevance
; sort is selected. Since relevance doesn't have a meaningful function with an empty
; search, this can be set to e.g. "PublicationDate:desc".
;empty_search_relevance_override = "PublicationDate:desc"

; This setting controls the default view for search results; the selected option
; should be one of the options present in the [Views] section below.
default_view         = list

; This section controls the result limit options for search results. default_limit
; sets the default number of results per page. limit_options is a comma-separated
; list of numbers to be presented to the end-user. If only one limit is required,
; set default_limit and leave limit_options commented out.
; WARNING: using large limits may require you to raise your PHP memory limits to
; avoid errors.
default_limit        = 20
;limit_options        = 10,20,40,60,80,100

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be
; recognized regardless of case.  If set to a comma-separated list of operators
; (e.g. "AND,NOT") then only the listed operators will be case-sensitive.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations], [SideRecommendations] or
; [NoResultsRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use Summon database recommendations at the
; top of the search results and all facets to the side.  You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.

; be used to apply those filters to the next search you perform.  This setting
; controls its default state: on (true) or off (false).

; this setting to have no default filters applied. These differ from hidden
; filters because they are visible in the UI and may be removed by the user.
;default_filters[] = "IsFullText:true"
;default_filters[] = "excludeNewspapers:true"

; Summon has a fixed cap on how many results you can page through.  Even though
; it may report more results than this number, you can't actually access results
; past the limit.  This setting tells VuFind where to cut off its paging mechanism.

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section

; Summon as they do in the regular Search module.

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
