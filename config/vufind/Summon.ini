; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be
; recognized regardless of case.  If set to a comma-separated list of operators
; (e.g. "AND,NOT") then only the listed operators will be case-sensitive.

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use Summon database recommendations at the
; top of the search results and all facets to the side.  You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.

; appear in fields displayed in search results (may not apply to all fields).

; Set this to true in order to include a text snippet in the search results when
; available.

; When you filter a search using facets, VuFind will present a checkbox that can
; be used to apply those filters to the next search you perform.  This setting
; controls its default state: on (true) or off (false).
retain_filters_by_default = true

; Summon has a fixed cap on how many results you can page through.  Even though
; it may report more results than this number, you can't actually access results
; past the limit.  This setting tells VuFind where to cut off its paging mechanism.

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; Summon as they do in the regular Search module.

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.
