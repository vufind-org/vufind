; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
; EBSCO offers searching via the EBSCOhost API. See the API
; documentation (https://support.ebsco.com/eit/ws.php) for more information.
; "prof" is your profile ID; "pwd" is the password associated with that profile;
; "dbs" is a comma-separated list of three-character codes for EBSCO databases
; to which your institution subscribes and for which access is available via the
; EBSCOhost API. Note that including any invalid code in this list - a code that
; does not exist, for a database to which you do not subscribe, or for a database
; that is not available via the EBSCOhost API - will cause EBSCO searches to fail
; entirely.
;
; NOTE: Because of licensing restrictions, by default, EBSCO results are only shown
; to users who have logged in to VuFind. This behavior can be changed by adjusting
; permissions.ini. Please be aware of any potential licensing issues that may arise
; if you allow users who are unaffiliated with your institution to create accounts
; in your VuFind instance or if you reconfigure the default behavior.
prof = prof.prof.prof
pwd = password
dbs = aph,reh,ehh,etc

; This is the EIT API base URL:
base_url = "https://eit.ebscohost.com/Services/SearchService.asmx/Search"

; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; This controls whether results are loaded with JavaScript when paging or changing
; settings. Loading results this way improves performance and accessibility, and is
; enabled by default. Loading will automatically fall back to non-JS mode if
; JavaScript is not supported by the browser.
load_results_with_js = true

; This setting can be used to configure pagination control on top of results.
; Possible options are:
; empty string or false  No top pagination (default)
; simple                 Simple next/prev button pagination
; full                   Full pagination alike to the one at the bottom of results
;top_paginator = simple

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of EIT pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with a
; field code available in one or more of the EBSCO databases. You can view a
; complete list of field codes by database by performing an "Info" search, as
; described at http://support.ebsco.com/eit/ws_api_info.php  The value of each
; setting is the text to display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run
; through the translator, so  be sure to update language files if necessary.
; The order of these settings will be maintained in the drop-down list in the
; UI.
[Basic_Searches]
TX           = "All Fields"
TI               = Title
AU              = Author
SU        = Subject

; This section defines which search options will be included on the advanced
; search screen.  All the notes above [Basic_Searches] also apply here.
[Advanced_Searches]
TX           = adv_search_all
TI               = adv_search_title
AU              = adv_search_author
SU        = adv_search_subject

; This section defines the sort options available on EIT search results.
; To view the available sort options by database, perform an "Info" search
; (http://support.ebsco.com/eit/ws_api_info.php).  Values on the right
; of the equal sign are text that will be run through the translation module
; and displayed on screen.
[Sorting]
relevance = sort_relevance
date = sort_year
date2 = sort_year_asc

; This section allows you to specify hidden sorting options. They can be used to create a
; whitelist of sort values using regular expressions. If you want to do this add regexes to
; the pattern[] array. All sort values that match at least one of these pattern are allowed
; in searches. But they will not be shown in the sort selection in the result list.
[HiddenSorting]
;pattern[] = .* ; E.g. uncomment this line to allow any value

[Record]
; Set this to true in order to enable "next" and "previous" links to navigate
; through the current result set from within the record view.
;next_prev_navigation = true
