; You can create a list of sitemap URLs in this file for use by the web crawler

[Cache]
; When set, the result of transforming sitemaps into Solr documents will
; be written to the specified directory in addition to being sent to Solr.
;transform_cache_dir = "/path/to/directory"

; When set to true, the transform cache will be "write-only" -- crawling
; will always fully re-fetch all data, and the cache will only be populated
; for reference/backup purposes.
; When set to false (the default), the crawler will attempt to reuse existing
; transformed data from the cache as long as the cache update date is newer
; than any last modification specified in the sitemap lastmod date. If the
; sitemap does not specify a modification date, the data will always be
; considered to be expired. The crawler can be permitted to read expired data
; from the cache with the --use-expired-cache flag, which can be useful if you
; need to very quickly rebuild your index (e.g. after a Solr upgrade) and do
; not mind if some of the data is out of date.
