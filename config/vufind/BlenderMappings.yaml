# Fields in each configuration provide mappings from field names used in Blender.ini
# to field names used in each backend.
# By default the field names and behavior match those used with Solr.
# Any missing mapping means that the backend does not support the field. For facets
# this means that any filter is ignored for the backend. For searches and sorting
# enabling a field that is not supported by all backends should be avoided as any
# missing fields are set to empty.

# In Facets Type indicates what kind of processing the facet needs. Allowed values
# are normal (default), hierarchical and boolean (checkbox facet).
