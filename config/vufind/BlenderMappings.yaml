# Fields in each configuration provide mappings from field names used in Blender.ini
# to field names used in each backend.
# By default the field names and behavior match those used with Solr.
# Any missing mapping means that the backend does not support the field. For facets
# this means that any filter is ignored for the backend. For searches and sorting
# enabling a field that is not supported by all backends should be avoided as any
# missing fields are set to empty.

# In Facets Type indicates what kind of processing the facet needs. Allowed values
# are normal (default), hierarchical and boolean (checkbox facet).
# Facets include filter mappings e.g. for checkbox facets.
#
# Settings:
# Field         Field name in backend
# Values        Mappings from backend values to VuFind
# DefaultValue  Value used for the backend unless another value is provided. For
#               example the pcAvailability filter by default limits results to those
#               that have full text available, so a DefaultValue can be used to
#               override it.
#
# Example:
#
# Facets:                             # Facet configuration section
#   Fields:                           # Field configuration
#     fulltext:                       # Field name in VuFind
#       Type: boolean                 # Field type
#       Mappings:                     # Mappings for backends
#         Solr:                       # Solr backend
#           Field: fulltext_boolean   # Use fulltext_boolean field with Solr
#         Primo:                      # Primo backend
#           Field: pcAvailability     # Use pcAvailability field with Primo
#           Values:                   # Value mappings
#             "false": 1              # Map 1 in VuFind to "false"
#           DefaultValue: "true"      # If no filter set, use "pcAvailability=true"
#         EDS:                        # EDS backend
#           Field: "LIMIT|FT"         # Use limiter "LIMIT|FT" with EDS
#           Values:                   # Map 1 in VuFind to "y"
#             y: 1
