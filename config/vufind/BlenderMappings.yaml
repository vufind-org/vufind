# Fields in each configuration provide mappings from field names used in Blender.ini
# to field names used in each backend.
# This example configuration is designed with the assumption that Solr is the primary
# search backend used, so the field names are based on the Solr fields. There is no
# dependency on Solr; it can be thought of as simply a naming convention.
# Any missing mapping means that the backend does not support the field. For facets
# this means that any filter is ignored for the backend. For searches and sorting
# enabling a field that is not supported by all backends should be avoided as any
# missing fields are set to empty.

# In Facets Type indicates what kind of processing the facet needs. Allowed values
# are normal (default) and boolean (checkbox facet).
# Facet settings include filter mappings e.g. for checkbox facets.
#
# Settings for mappings:
# Field         Field name in backend
# Values        Mappings from backend values to VuFind for facets and the other way
#               for active filters.
# Hierarchical  Boolean setting indicating that the values should be mapped to a
#               hierarchical facet. This ensures that when a value is mapped to
#               a sub-level hierarchy item, facet counts for its parents get
#               incremented as well.
# Unmapped      How to handle values with no mappings when building facets. Possible
#               values:
#               "keep" - Use the values as is (default)
#               "drop" - Drop the values from facets
# Ignore        true to ignore all values for a filter, or an array of values to
#               ignore. Otherwise any filter value that does not have a field and
#               value mapping causes the backend to be disabled for the search.
# DefaultValue  Filter value used for the backend unless a filter is active.
#               For example the pcAvailability filter by default limits results to
#               those that have full text available, so a DefaultValue can be used to
#               override it.

#       Mappings:                     # Mappings for backends
#         Solr:                       # Solr backend
#           Field: fulltext_boolean   # Use fulltext_boolean field with Solr
#         Primo:                      # Primo backend
#           Field: pcAvailability     # Use pcAvailability field with Primo
#           Values:                   # Value mappings
#             "false": 1              # Map 1 in VuFind to "false"
#           DefaultValue: "true"      # If no filter set, use "pcAvailability=true"
#         EDS:                        # EDS backend
#           Field: "LIMIT|FT"         # Use limiter "LIMIT|FT" with EDS
#           Values:                   # Map 1 in VuFind to "y"
#             y: 1
