; circumstances. However, it may also be overly exclusive, as some of the block
; reasons are for relatively minor circumstances. Including a block code in this
;  comma-separated list will prevent that situation from blocking a user from making
; requests (unless the status also blocks the patron explicitly through other API
; calls). See this page for a list of numeric codes:
; https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/voyager/apis/RESTfulWebServices/PatronBlocks
