; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may

;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use all facets ON the side. You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]

; If you customize your facet display, be sure to add any new facet configuration

; should prefix the section name with a ~ character to ensure proper loading.
