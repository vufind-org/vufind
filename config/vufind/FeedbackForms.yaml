# Listing of configured forms.
#
# Configured forms are listed in the top level 'forms' array and can accessed via the URL:
# /Feedback/Form/<form-id>
#
# The main Feedback form (id: FeedbackSite) can be accessed with a shorter URL /Feedback
#
# Form supports the following options:
#
#   enabled (boolean) Is the form enabled? (default = true)
#   useCaptcha (boolean) Should the form use Captcha validation? Requires the "feedback"
#                        option to be turned on in the config.ini [Captcha] form setting.
#                        (default = true, if Captcha turned on for feedback overall).
#   reportReferrer (boolean) Should the form report the page from which it was invoked
#   reportUserAgent (boolean) Should the form report the browser's user agent string
#   title (string) Form title (translation key)
#   onlyForLoggedUsers (boolean) Require the user to be logged in to see the form
#                                (default = false)
#   emailSubject (string) Email subject (translation key). (default = email_subject
#                         value from config.ini [Feedback] section, or 'VuFind Feedback')
#                         The subject may contain placeholders (for example %%receiver%%)
#                         that are replaced with submitted form values.
#   emailFrom (address in email envelope, separate from user's email)
#     name (string)  Sender name (default = sender_name setting from config.ini
#                    [Feedback] section)
#     email (string) Sender email (default = sender_email setting from
#                    config.ini [Feedback] section)
#   recipient
#     name (string)  Recipient name (default = recipient_name setting from config.ini
#                    [Feedback] section)
#     email (string) Recipient email address (default = recipient_email setting from
#                    config.ini [Feedback] section)
#
#   Multiple recipients can be configured using a list:
#
#   recipient:
#     - name: Recipient 1
#       email: recipient1@email
#     - name: Recipient 2
#       email: recipient2@email
#
#   response (string) Reponse after form submit (translation key)

#   primaryHandler (string)   Handlers to process form data - default is 'email', available
#                             options are: 'email', 'database'. When this handler fails, the
#                             whole feedback send action fails. You can add your own handler
#                             by implementing \VuFind\Form\Handler\HandlerInterface, and adding
#                             it to module config under key:
#                               'vufind' -> 'plugin_manager' -> 'form_handler'
#                             Example:
#                               primaryHandler: database
#   secondaryHandlers (array) Additional handlers could be defined here. They can fail silently,
#                             but could be useful as safety/notify handlers.
#                             Example:
#                               secondaryHandlers:

#                           prefillFields:
#                             - siteCode

#     settings (array)     HTML attributes as key-value pairs, for example:

#
#     help (array)
#      pre (string)      Like above.
