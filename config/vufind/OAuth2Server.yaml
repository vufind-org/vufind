# OAuth2 Server Configuration.
#
# See https://vufind.org/wiki/configuration:oauth2_oidc for more information.
#
# An example for generating the private/public key pair:
#
# openssl genrsa -out local/config/vufind/oauth2_private.key 2048
# chown apache local/config/vufind/oauth2_private.key
# chmod 600 local/config/vufind/oauth2_private.key
# openssl rsa -in local/config/vufind/oauth2_private.key -pubout > local/config/vufind/oauth2_public.key
# chown apache local/config/vufind/oauth2_public.key
# chmod 600 local/config/vufind/oauth2_public.key

# Authorization server configuration
Server:
  # User field to be used as identifier in tokens.
  # Needs to be one of the unique fields id, username, cat_id.
  # Note: The field needs to be unique and required for every user. There are systems
  # where the cat_id is not required. Creating tokens for users without a cat_id will
  # result in an error.
  # Security Warning! The tokens are not encrypted. Hence, the used field will be readable
  # by everyone who has access to the token.
  userIdentifierField: "id"
  # Create keys e.g. as above and point the following setting to it. The paths can be
  # absolute or relative to the config directory.
  privateKeyPath: "oauth2_private.key"
  publicKeyPath: "oauth2_public.key"
  # Encryption key used to encrypt payloads. Make sure it is random and long enough
  # (at least 32 characters).
  encryptionKey: ""
  # Salt for hashes (e.g. library_user_id claim). Make sure it is random and long
  # enough (at least 32 characters).
  hashSalt: ""
  # Uncomment to disable key permission checks. Only meant for testing, so avoid in
  # any production-like environment if possible.
  #keyPermissionChecks: false
  # Optional URL for public documentation (returned in the discovery response)
  documentationUrl: ""

# Known clients configuration
Clients:
  example:
    # Client name
    name: Foo Client
    # Redirect URI
    redirectUri: "https://oauth-client/auth"
    # Whether to use PKCE (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636 for details). Must
    # be enabled for non-confidential clients.
    pkce: true
    # Whether the client is confidential (as opposed to a public one such as an
    # in-browser app). Only confidential clients can be verified by the client
    # secret.
    isConfidential: false
    # Hash of a client secret. You can use the following command to get a hash for a
    # password:
    # php -r 'echo password_hash("secret",  PASSWORD_DEFAULT) . PHP_EOL;'
    # Note that a secret can only be used with confidential clients since public
    # ones have no way of using it securely.
    secret: ""
    # By default a client can request all scopes. This setting can be used to limit
    # the allowed scopes to a subset of all available ones.
    #allowedScopes:
    #  - openid
    #  - email

# Scope configuration. Keys are scope identifiers. Each identifier should include a
# description (translation key) to be displayed to the user. The ils field should be
# set to true if the information comes from a user profile in the library system.
# This allows VuFind to display the library login or card selection form when
# appropriate.
# The claims configuration key maps a scope to a set of user claims (attributes).
# See ClaimMappings below for mappings from VuFind fields to OAuth2 claims.
# Note that the OpenID Connect specification defines several standard claims
# (see https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims).
# Note also that some or most of the information may only be available when the user
# has an active library card.

# of the following:
# - full_name     User's full name
# - age           User's age in years
# - block_status  Whether the user has blocks in ILS (true/false or null if unknown)
# - address_json  Address fields in JSON (see
#                 https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AddressClaim)
# - library_user_id_hash A unique hash of cat_id or getCatUsername (typically library
#                        card number but can be e.g. an email as well). The field is
#                        padded with hashSalt before hashing.
