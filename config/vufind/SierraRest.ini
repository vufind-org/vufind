[Authentication]
; When using patron-specific data access, different values may be used as the
; username and password when the user logs in via CAS, depending on how Sierra is
; configured. This section defines which POST fields are populated with the
; cat_username and cat_password values stored in VuFind. Legal values are "code"
; (user code -- possibly barcode or unique ID), "name" (user's full name) and "pin"
; (user-defined PIN number).
; N.B. username_field and password_field have no effect when global patron data is
; used (redirect_uri above is not set).
username_field = "code"
password_field = "pin"
; Authentication method to use with global patron data access. Default is "native".
; "ldap" is supported for REST API v6 and later (see api_version above).
; IMPORTANT: when using "native" authentication, the driver assumes by default that
; users have PINs, and that the cat_password field contains the user's PIN. In some
; Sierra configurations, PINs may not be validated, which may result in reduced
; system security. Be sure to test the driver by entering incorrect PINs to confirm
; that actual validation is being performed. If PINs do not work, see the
; patron_validation_field below for an alternate approach.
;method = "native"
; Sierra varField used to lookup a patron when password is not verified (e.g.
; cat_username gets populated from institutional login). Default is "b" for barcode.
; "u" could be used for uniqueId depending on Sierra configuration.
;patron_lookup_field = "b"
; For Sierra systems that do not support PINs, you can activate the setting below to
; use a different type of cat_password value to confirm user identities. This is most
; useful when populating your cat_username/cat_password values automatically through
; an institutional login. Legal values are "name" (the user's full name) or "email"
; (the user's email address). "email" is strongly preferred since it is more likely
; to be a unique identifier. When patron_validation_field is activated, PIN checks
; will be disabled. The patron_validation_field setting is disabled by default.
;patron_validation_field = "email"

; This section is used to define library codes and named values which are used by the
; system to indicate the location at which a hold is to be collected. Sierra REST API
