; An optional catalog id that is used in the translation string when translating
; location names and opac messages. E.g. setting the id to "sierra" would make the
; translation key for location code h01a "location_sierra_h01a" while leaving it
; commented out would use "location_h01a". Translation is optional, and if a
; translation for the location code cannot be found, the location name from Sierra
; is used.
