; For each driver method it can be specified which drivers should be used and how they can be composed.
; The section needs to be [<driver method name>]. main_driver specifies the driver that is primarily used.
; The results of the main driver can be composed with other driver results. Therefore, one needs to specify
; merge_keys for the support drivers. All results of the support drivers are then matched with the keys of the main
; driver. E.g. for the method getHolding the results of multiple drivers can get composed if they match on "item_id".
; The array support_keys specifies which of there keys of the given support driver should be composed with the main result.
; The format is: support_keys["<DriverName"] = "<key1>,<key2>,...,<keyN>"

; Here are some examples of how a configuration could look like for a combination of DAIA and PAIA
; but 'getHolding' most likely won't work with driver3. The Demo driver does not provide the same item_ids
; as the other drivers.
