; These are the settings and credentials used to connect to Koha's MySQL database.
; When using Koha versions earlier than 18.05, the username and password can be found
; in /etc/koha/sites/library/koha-conf.xml. When using Koha 18.05 or newer, it may be
; necessary to create new credentials specifically for access by VuFind, by logging
; in to the MySQL console and running commands like:
;      CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
;      GRANT SELECT ON database.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
host        = localhost
port        = 3306
username    = mysqlusername
password    = mysqlpassword
database    = koha
url         = http://library.myuniversity.edu

; If we trust our authentication source and know it to be the same as the one used by
; koha then we can choose to not validate our patron's passwords (Useful if you are
; using SAML/Shibboleth for authentication for both VuFind and Koha)
dontValidatePasswords = false

; This section translates Koha's internal location codes into strings for on-screen
; display.  You can customize the text to your liking.
