; If you want the returned "availability" to be an instance of AvailabilityStatus you have to set
; "use_status_class" to true. Extra status information will be included in the instance if you add
; it in the field "extraStatusInformation".
; See the demo driver's getRandomHolding() method for a list of fields that are additionally supported.
; Any omitted fields will be overwritten with random results from getRandomHolding.
;
; This mechanism is primarily intended for use with automated testing.
;
; The example below forces two item records to be created for bib record 1234,
; with locations of "foo" and "bar" respectively. For the second item the availability will be
; returned as an instance of AvailabilityStatus and with the extra status information "{"extraInfo": true}";
