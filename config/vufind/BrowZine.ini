; should be one of the options present in the [Views] section below.
default_view         = list

; This controls whether results are loaded with JavaScript when paging or changing
; settings. Loading results this way improves performance and accessibility, and is
; enabled by default. Loading will automatically fall back to non-JS mode if
; JavaScript is not supported by the browser.
load_results_with_js = true

; This setting can be used to configure pagination control on top of results.
; Possible options are:
; empty string or false  No top pagination (default)

; full                   Full pagination alike to the one at the bottom of results
;top_paginator = simple

; setting, or to "exclude" to filter out the options listed in the "filter"
; setting. The default is "none," which performs no filtering.
;filterType = exclude
; This repeatable section can be used to filter based on link type; legal
; options are the keys defined in DOIServices section.
; Note that this setting is available for convenience and compatibility with previous
; versions. You can get the same results by changing the DOIServices section.
;filter[] = "browzineWebLink"
;filter[] = "fullTextFile"

; This setting controls icons displayed with links. If set to false, icons are loaded
; from Third Iron's assets. If true, icons defined in the DOIServices section are
; used. Default is false.
