; This file controls how denied permissions are treated within VuFind.
;
; The permissions need to be set in permissions.ini.
; In this file you can configure what should happen if a permission is denied.
; Please use the permission names from permissions.ini as section names here.
;
; Example:
;
; This role from permissions.ini:
;
; [default.EITModule]
; role = loggedin
; permission = access.EITModule
;
; should be configured here in section:
;
; [access.EITModule]
;
; See permissions.ini for more permissions that you may also wish to configure here.
;
; Within each section, there are two options which can be configured:
;
; deniedTemplateBehavior: The behavior to apply when a permission is denied
; dynamically within a template; i.e. the user has access to a page but is blocked
; from a particular feature of that page. If undefined, the default behavior is
; to hide the affected functionality and display no special message.
;
; deniedControllerBehavior: The behavior to apply when a permission is denied at the
; controller level; i.e. the user is totally blocked from accessing something. If
; undefined, the default behavior defined by the controller (usually promptLogin)
; will be applied.
;
; Each of these options may be set to one of the following options; most options
; also receive a colon-delimited list of parameters.
;
; exception - Throw the specified exception class (param 1) with the specified
;     exception message (param 2).
;     This option is ONLY supported by deniedControllerBehavior.
;     example: deniedControllerBehavior = exception:MyExceptionClass:Access Denied.
;
; promptLogin - Redirect the user to the login page. You can optionally set the
;     first parameter to a message to display on the login page (omit for default).
;     This option is ONLY supported by deniedControllerBehavior.
;     example: deniedControllerBehavior = promptLogin
;
; showMessage - Display the message (the first parameter) to the user; this text
;     will be run through the translator. When used as the deniedControllerBehavior,
;     the message will be displayed in the form of a flash message on the
;     "permission denied" screen. When used as the deniedTemplateBehavior, the text
;     will be displayed in place of the blocked markup.
;     example: deniedControllerBehavior = showMessage:Blocked!
;
; showTemplate - Render a specific template, specified as the first parameter.
;     This option is ONLY supported by deniedTemplateBehavior.
;     example: deniedTemplateBehavior = showTemplate:error/denied

; Section for global parameters
[global]
; The default behavior will get used if a permission is denied, but the controller
; in question defines no default behavior and no permission denied behavior has been
; configured in this file for the relevant permission.
defaultDeniedControllerBehavior = "promptLogin"

; The default behavior will get used if a permission is denied, but no permission
; denied behavior has been configured in this file for the relevant permission.
; (False means "use the default behavior defined by the template").
defaultDeniedTemplateBehavior = false

; This setting can be used to override access permissions for controllers. You can
; set a controller class name inside the brackets to explicitly override that
; controller's access permission (and that of any of its children, unless more
; specific permissions are set for those subclasses), whether or not it has a
; default defined in the class. You can use * inside the brackets to set a default
; access permission that is applied to all controllers that do not have an
; internally-defined default (the MyResearchController is also excluded from
; this setting to avoid infinite login redirects). This can be useful if you
; wish to password-protect your entire site.
;controllerAccess[*] = access.VuFindInterface
;controllerAccess[VuFind\Controller\SearchController] = access.SearchResults

; Configuration for EIT (needed to make it behave correctly in combined
; searches):
[access.EITModule]
deniedTemplateBehavior = showTemplate:error/loginForAccess

; Example configuration for non-standard favorites permission behavior:
;[feature.Favorites]
;deniedTemplateBehavior = "showMessage:Login for Favorites"
; Note that VuFind loads the MyResearch/Favorites action by default, so be
; careful about blocking this at the controller level. If you conditionally
; block this for some users, you should change the defaultAccountPage in
; config.ini to avoid causing login problems.
;deniedControllerBehavior = "exception::You are not logged in!"
