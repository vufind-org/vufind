; KohaRest driver configuration
;
; The KohaRest driver uses only Koha's REST APIs for all functionality. It does not
; need the ILS-DI API or database access. However, there are some prerequisites for
; Koha that must be completed on the Koha server first:
;
; 1. Plugins are enabled. See
;    https://koha-community.org/manual/20.11/en/html/plugins.html
; 2. REST plugin for discovery interfaces
;    (https://github.com/natlibfi/koha-plugin-rest-di) is installed and enabled in
;    Koha. Verify by visiting /api/v1 on Koha server and check that there are routes
;    beginning with /contrib/kohasuomi .
; 3. OAuth2 is enabled for the REST API in Koha (see below).
; 4. A user account with sufficient privileges is created, and an API
;    key is added to the user (see below).

[Catalog]
; The API address without any version such as v1
host = "http://koha-server/api"
; N.B. The KohaRest driver uses OAuth2 authentication with Koha. Please follow the
; steps below to configure OAuth2 in Koha and setup the credentials for a patron
; account. Patron's user name and password are not used here, as OAuth2 relies on a
; key/secret pair for authentication.
;
; Make sure the RestOAuth2ClientCredentials preference is enabled in Koha, and
; that the Koha server has the Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer cpan module
; installed (minimum version 0.16).
; See https://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=20624 for more
; information.
;
; If an API request to Koha returns an error with HTTP status 401 (the error message
; may vary), Koha's Apache server may be removing the Authorization header from
; incoming requests. Add the following line to the virtual host configuration(s) in
; Koha's Apache server configuration to make it pass the header through to Koha:
;
; SetEnvIf Authorization .+ HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$0
;
; You should create a Koha user for the API with at least the following privileges:
; - circulate_remaining_permissions
; - catalogue
; - borrowers
;   - edit_borrowers
;   - view_borrower_infos_from_any_libraries
; - reserveforothers
; - modify_holds_priority
; - place_holds
; - updatecharges
;   - payout
;   - remaining_permissions
;
; Add an API key to the user and copy the values for Client ID and Secret below.
; To add an API key in Koha, go to the patron screen and click More -> Manage API
; keys. On this screen you can generate a new ID/Secret pair for OAuth2
; authentication.
;
; Koha API Client ID for OAuth2 authentication
clientId = ""
; Koha API Client Secret for OAuth2 authentication
clientSecret = ""

; This section controls hold behavior; note that you must also ensure that Holds are
; enabled in the [Catalog] section of config.ini in order to take advantage of these
; settings. Additional notes about some of these settings are available in the wiki:

; during hold form processing. Most users should not need to change this setting.
HMACKeys = item_id:holdtype:level

; defaultRequiredDate - A colon-separated list used to set the default "not required
; after" date for holds in the format days:months:years
; e.g. 0:1:0 will set a "not required after" date of 1 month from the current date

; 3) a value within the Location IDs returned by getPickUpLocations()
defaultPickUpLocation = ""

; By default the pick up location list is sorted alphabetically. This setting can be
; used to manually set the order by entering location IDs as a colon-separated list.
; You can also disable sorting by setting this to false.

; This section allows modification of the default mappings from item status codes to

[ItemStatusMappings]
;Item::Held = "Held"

;Item::NotForLoan4 = "At Bindery"
;Item::Lost4 = "Lost--Library Applied"
; Also "Not For Loan" item types can be mapped by appending the authorized value to
; the status key like this:
;ItemType::NotForLoan1 = "Reference Desk"

; Uncomment the following lines to enable password (PIN) change
;[changePassword]
; PIN change parameters. The default limits are taken from the interface documentation.
