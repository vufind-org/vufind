; KohaRest driver configuration
;
; The KohaRest driver uses only Koha's REST APIs for all functionality. It does not
; need the ILS-DI API or database access. However, there are some prerequisites for
; Koha that must be completed on the Koha server first:
;
; 1. Plugins are enabled. See
;    https://koha-community.org/manual/20.11/en/html/plugins.html
; 2. REST plugin for discovery interfaces
;    (https://github.com/natlibfi/koha-plugin-rest-di) is installed and enabled in
;    Koha. Verify by visiting /api/v1 on Koha server and check that there are routes
;    beginning with /contrib/kohasuomi .
; 3. OAuth2 is enabled for the REST API in Koha (see below).
; 4. A user account with sufficient privileges is created, and an API
;    key is added to the user (see below).

[Catalog]
; The API address without any version such as v1
host = "http://koha-server/api"
; N.B. The KohaRest driver uses OAuth2 authentication with Koha. Please follow the
; steps below to configure OAuth2 in Koha and setup the credentials for a patron
; account. Patron's user name and password are not used here, as OAuth2 relies on a
; key/secret pair for authentication.
;
; Make sure the RestOAuth2ClientCredentials preference is enabled in Koha, and
; that the Koha server has the Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer cpan module
; installed (minimum version 0.16).
; See https://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=20624 for more
; information.
;
; If an API request to Koha returns an error with HTTP status 401 (the error message
; may vary), Koha's Apache server may be removing the Authorization header from
; incoming requests. Add the following line to the virtual host configuration(s) in
; Koha's Apache server configuration to make it pass the header through to Koha:
;
; SetEnvIf Authorization .+ HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$0
;
; You should create a Koha user for the API with at least the following privileges:
; - circulate_remaining_permissions
; - catalogue
; - borrowers
;   - edit_borrowers
;   - view_borrower_infos_from_any_libraries
; - reserveforothers
; - modify_holds_priority
; - place_holds
; - updatecharges
;   - payout
;   - remaining_permissions
; - recalls
;   - manage_recalls
;
; Add an API key to the user and copy the values for Client ID and Secret below.
; To add an API key in Koha, go to the patron screen and click More -> Manage API
; keys. On this screen you can generate a new ID/Secret pair for OAuth2
; authentication.
;
; Koha API Client ID for OAuth2 authentication
clientId = ""
; Koha API Client Secret for OAuth2 authentication
clientSecret = ""
; Your Koha OPAC record display URL, if you want to provide direct links to your Koha
; OPAC. You can include a %%id%% placeholder to indicate where a URL-encoded bib ID
; should be inserted; if the placeholder is omitted, the ID will be appended on the
; end. Leave this commented out to omit OPAC links.
;opacURL = "http://koha-server/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=%%id%%"

; If we trust our authentication source and know it to be the same as the one used by
; Koha then we can choose to not validate our patron's passwords (Useful if you are
; using SAML/Shibboleth for authentication for both VuFind and Koha)
;
; It is strongly recommended that you set allowUserLogin to false in the [Catalog] section
; of config.ini when setting this value to true.
