; HMACKeys - A list of hold form element names that will be analyzed for consistency
; during hold form processing. Most users should not need to change this setting.
HMACKeys = item_id:holdtype:level

; defaultRequiredDate - A colon-separated list used to set the default "not required
; after" date for holds in the format days:months:years
; e.g. 0:1:0 will set a "not required after" date of 1 month from the current date
defaultRequiredDate = 0:0:2

; extraHoldFields - A colon-separated list used to display extra visible fields in the
; place holds form. Supported values are "requiredByDate" and "pickUpLocation"

; A Pick Up Location Code used to pre-select the pick up location drop down list and
; provide a default option if others are not available. Must be one of the following:

; 2) "user-selected" to indicate that the user always has to choose the location
; 3) a value within the Location IDs returned by getPickUpLocations()
defaultPickUpLocation = ""

; By default the pick up location list is sorted alphabetically. This setting can be
; used to manually set the order by entering location IDs as a colon-separated list.
; You can also disable sorting by setting this to false.
