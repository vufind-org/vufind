; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be
; recognized regardless of case.

; URL of the Primo server. For hosted services typically of the form
; http://XYZ.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com:1701 where XYZ is the ID of the Primo
; instance (e.g. primoapac01). Use http://mlplus.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com for
; MetaLib Plus.
; You may also enter the full URL including a path to the brief search if necessary.
url = "http://XYZ.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com:1701"

; This section controls the result limit options for search results. default_limit
; sets the default number of results per page. limit_options is a comma-separated
; list of numbers to be presented to the end-user. If only one limit is required,
; set default_limit and leave limit_options commented out.
; WARNING: using large limits may require you to raise your PHP memory limits to
; avoid errors.

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations], [SideRecommendations] or
; [NoResultsRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.

; the Primo API

; When you filter a search using facets, VuFind will present a checkbox that can
; be used to apply those filters to the next search you perform.  This setting
; controls its default state: on (true) or off (false).

; this setting to have no default filters applied. These differ from hidden
; filters because they are visible in the UI and may be removed by the user.
;default_filters[] = "rtype:Books"

; Primo has a fixed cap on how many results you can page through.  Even though
; it may report more results than this number, you can't actually access results
; past the limit.  This setting tells VuFind where to cut off its paging mechanism.

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; Primo as they do in the regular Search module.

; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.
;[TopRecommendations]

; The name of the index field is on the left

; Any facets named in the list below will have their values run through the
; translation code; unlisted facets will displayed as-is without translation. For
; translated facets, be sure that all of the necessary strings are included in the
; language files found in the languages directory. You may add a colon and the
; name of a text domain after the field name to specify translations in a specific
; text domain (subdirectory of the languages folder). If you comment out the lines
; below, no facets will be translated.

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of Primo pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with an
; index defined in the Primo API.  The value of each setting is the text to
; display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run through the translator, so
; be sure to update language files if necessary.  The order of these settings
; will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.

; This section specifies permission rules which may be used to determine the
; institution code and access level for the current user when retrieving Primo
; results. institutionCode is evaluated first, then onCampusRule, with
; defaultCode used only when no more specific rule is matched.
[Institutions]
; Simple example:
onCampusRule['MYINSTITUTION'] = "primoOnCampus.MYINSTITUTION"
; Consortial example:
;onCampusRule['MEMBER1'] = "primoOnCampus.MEMBER1"
;onCampusRule['MEMBER2'] = "primoOnCampus.MEMBER2"
; The onCampusRule section maps an institution code (e.g. MEMBER1 above) to a
; permission name (e.g. primoOnCampus.MEMBER1 above). See permissions.ini for
; more details on how to define permissions.
; If a specific onCampusRule is matched above, the user will be considered to
; be on campus at the matching institution.
; Note that onCampusRule is REQUIRED if you want any of your users to see full
; results from Primo. If you do not set this up, users will only be able to see
; more limited, public-oriented results.
;onCampusRule['DEFAULT'] = "primo.isOnDefaultCampus"
; The institutionCode setting is formatted similarly to onCampusRule but rarely
; needs to be used. If you wish to select a PrimoCentral institution code based
; on a permission setting, BUT you do not want to grant full on-campus permissions,
; you can use this setting. For most common scenarios, you only need onCampusRule
; and/or defaultCode.
;institutionCode['MEMBER1'] = primo.memberOf.MEMBER1
; The defaultCode is used as a fallback, if none of the institutionCodes AND none
; of the onCampusRules match.
; If you set it, all of your users can use Primo (though they will see limited
; results when they fail to match the appropriate onCampusRule above).
; If you omit it, only users matching an onCampusRule or institutionCode can use
; Primo.
;defaultCode = "DEFAULT"
