; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
; For PrimoCentral API documentation:
; http://www.exlibrisgroup.org/display/PrimoOI/Brief+Search
; Note: you will need your EL Commons credentials to access documentation
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be
; recognized regardless of case.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; HTTP timeout
timeout = 30

; Primo API to use. Possible values are:
;   legacy     Legacy brief search API (default, and the only option before VuFind 10)
;   rest       REST API (less buggy, supports also boolean NOT and cites/cited by functions)
;api = legacy

; ONLY when `api = legacy` above:
; URL of the Primo server. For hosted services typically of the form
; https://XYZ.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com where XYZ is the ID of the Primo
; instance (e.g. primoapac01).
; You may also enter the full URL including a path to the brief search if necessary.
;url = "https://XYZ.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com"

; ONLY when `api = rest` above:
; Search URL of the Primo server. For hosted services typically of the form
; https://api-XY.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/v1/search?vid=...&tab=...&scope=...&apikey=...
; where XY is the region ID of the Primo instance (na, eu, ap, ca or cn). The URL
; should also contain scope, vid, tab etc. as well.
; See https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/apis/docs/primoSearch/R0VUIC9wcmltby92MS9zZWFyY2g=/
; for more information.
; {{INSTCODE}} in the URL is replaced with the institution code determined by the
; rules in the [Institutions] section.
;search_url = "https://api-XY.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/v1/search?vid={{INSTCODE}}&tab=default_tab&scope=default_scope&apikey=<apikey>"
; On-premises example:
;search_url = "https://onpremises-primo-host/primo_library/libweb/webservices/rest/primo-explore/v1/pnxs?vid={{INSTCODE}}&tab={{INSTCODE}}&scope=CDI&inst={{INSTCODE}}"

; ONLY when `api = rest` above:
; JWT URL of the Primo server. For hosted services typically of the form
; https://api-XY.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/v1/jwt/<institution_code>?lang=en_US&vid=<view_code>
; where XY is the region ID of the Primo instance (na, eu, ap, ca or cn).
; {{INSTCODE}} in the URL is replaced with the institution code determined by the
; rules in the [Institutions] section.
; N.B. For hosted Primo you can probably leave jwt_url unspecified or empty, and
; include the apikey parameter in search_url setting.
;jwt_url = "https://api-na.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/v1/jwt/{{INSTCODE}}?lang=en_US&vid={{INSTCODE}}&apikey=<apikey>"

; This section controls the result limit options for search results. default_limit
; sets the default number of results per page. limit_options is a comma-separated
; list of numbers to be presented to the end-user. If only one limit is required,
; set default_limit and leave limit_options commented out.
; WARNING: using large limits may cause problems due to a variety of limitations,
; especially if you support bulk operations (which can cause large URLs/requests).
; If you must support large page sizes, you may need to raise the PHP memory_limit
; and max_input_vars settings and/or adjust the Apache LimitRequestLine setting.

; This setting can be used to configure pagination control on top of results.
; Possible options are:

[FacetLabels]
; This setting lists configuration sections containing facet field => label

; should prefix the section name with a ~ character to ensure proper loading.

; This section specifies permission rules which may be used to determine the
; view code and access level for the current user when retrieving Primo
; results. institutionCode is evaluated first, then onCampusRule, with
; defaultCode used only when no more specific rule is matched.
; Please note that these settings are only applied for certain keys; they are
; not regulating the access to the module at all. If you are using onCampusRule,
; be sure to allow access to the Primo module in permissions.ini separately.
; You need to have the permission 'access.PrimoModule' in permissions.ini for that.
; See https://vufind.org/wiki/configuration:permission_options for further
; information about permission settings related to Primo.
[Institutions]
; Simple example:
onCampusRule['MYINSTITUTION'] = "primoOnCampus.MYINSTITUTION"
; Consortial example:
;onCampusRule['MEMBER1'] = "primoOnCampus.MEMBER1"
;onCampusRule['MEMBER2'] = "primoOnCampus.MEMBER2"
; The onCampusRule section maps an institution code (e.g. MEMBER1 above) to a
; permission name (e.g. primoOnCampus.MEMBER1 above). See permissions.ini for
; more details on how to define permissions.
; If a specific onCampusRule is matched above, the user will be considered to
; be on campus at the matching institution.
; Note that onCampusRule is REQUIRED if you want any of your users to see full
; results from Primo. If you do not set this up, users will only be able to see
; more limited, public-oriented results.
;onCampusRule['DEFAULT'] = "primo.isOnDefaultCampus"
; The institutionCode setting is formatted similarly to onCampusRule but rarely
; needs to be used. If you wish to select a PrimoCentral institution code based
; on a permission setting, BUT you do not want to grant full on-campus permissions,
; you can use this setting. For most common scenarios, you only need onCampusRule
; and/or defaultCode.
;institutionCode['MEMBER1'] = primo.memberOf.MEMBER1
; The defaultCode is used as a fallback, if none of the institutionCodes AND none
; of the onCampusRules match.
; If you set it, all of your users can use Primo (though they will see limited
; results when they fail to match the appropriate onCampusRule above).
; If you omit it, only users matching an onCampusRule or institutionCode can use
; Primo.
