; the order of values in this comma-separated list will impact display order.

; Advanced limiters are select type limiters to show on the advanced search screen;
; omit this to display all available limiters. See [Facets] below for a list of legal

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations], [SideRecommendations] or
; [NoResultsRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use all facets ON the side. You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.

; on the next search and provide a reset button to clear them (true), or should it
; always perform new searches unfiltered (false)?

; setting to allow an untrusted certificate.

; This is the HTTP method to use for EDS search operations; legal options are GET
; or POST (the default). GET and POST use significantly different APIs, so it
; may be useful to switch between methods for troubleshooting purposes. Under
; normal circumstances, POST is preferred because GET has some character length
; limits that do not affect the POST-based API.

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; EDS as they do in the regular Search module.

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.
