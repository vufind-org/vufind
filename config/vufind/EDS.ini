; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use all facets ON the side. You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.
;default_top_recommend[] = TopFacets:FacetsTop:EDS
default_side_recommend[] = SideFacets:Facets:CheckboxFacets:EDS
default_noresults_recommend[] = SwitchType

; When you filter a search using facets, VuFind will present a checkbox that can
; be used to apply those filters to the next search you perform.  This setting
; controls its default state: on (true) or off (false).

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; EDS as they do in the regular Search module.

; This section is used to identify facets for special treatment by the SideFacets

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.
