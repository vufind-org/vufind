; Multiple targets may be separated by commas.  Do not use qualifiers unless you
; really need to -- logging all statistics to the same target makes reporting
; more effective.
;
; Note: Statistics gathering includes browser detection.  For best results, make

;
; VuFind currently supports four logging levels: alert (severe fatal error),
; error (fatal error), notice (non-fatal warning) and debug (informational).
;
; Each logging level can be further broken down into five levels of verbosity.
; You can specify the desired level by adding a dash and a number after the
; level in the configuration string -- for example, alert-2 or error-5.
; The higher the number, the more detailed the logging messages.  If verbosity
; is not specified, it defaults to 1 (least detailed).
;
; Several logging methods are available, and each may be configured to log any
; combination of levels.
;
; You may enable multiple logging mechanisms if you want -- in fact, it is
; recommended, since the failure of one logging mechanism (i.e. database down,
; file system full) may then be reported to another.
;
; If database is uncommented, messages will be logged to the named MySQL table.
; The table can be created with this SQL statement:
; CREATE TABLE log_table ( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
;     logtime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, ident CHAR(16) NOT NULL,
;     priority INT NOT NULL, message TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (id) );
;
; If file is uncommented, messages will be logged to the named file.  Be sure
; that Apache has permission to write to the specified file!

; Be careful with this setting: a flood of errors can easily bog down your mail
; server!
