    <h2>About VuFind®</h2>

    <p>
      VuFind® is a discovery system designed and developed for libraries by libraries. It is also flexible enough
      to build search interfaces for all kinds of content beyond the library environment. The goal of VuFind® is
      to enable your users to search and browse through all of your resources in a single consistent and user-friendly
      interface. Content could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catalog records</li>
      <li>Institutional repository content</li>
      <li>Open access journal articles</li>
      <li>Digitized library materials</li>
      <li>Websites</li>
      <li>Items available for interlibrary loan</li>
      <li>Licensed content (where supported by providers)</li>
      <li>Other collections and resources &mdash; just add metadata!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      VuFind® is completely modular and includes tools to support a wide range of use cases, from a basic Library
      catalog search to a sophisticated dashboard of data from many sources. It supports building a local
      index and/or integrating with a variety of existing third-party services. Since it's
      <a href="https://github.com/vufind-org/">open source</a>, you can modify or add modules to best fit your needs.
      A wide range of configurable options allow extensive customization without changing any code. An active and
      friendly international <a href="https://vufind.org/wiki/community">community</a> and a variety of
      <a href="https://vufind.org/vufind/support.html">commercial service providers</a> mean that you can get
      support when you need it.
    </p>

    <h2>Power</h2>
    VuFind® runs on Solr Energy. Apache Solr, an open source search engine, offers amazing performance and scalability to allow for VuFind® to respond to search queries in milliseconds time. It has the ability to be distributed if you need to spread the load of the catalog over many servers or in a server farm environment.

    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    VuFind® is offered for free through the GPL open source license. This means that you can use the software for free. You can modify the software and share your successes with the community!

      <b>"I love the 'text this' option in the catalog. It saves paper, I don't have to find the scrap of paper I wrote on, and I don't have to wonder if I transposed the call number. (I just have to have my cell phone with me!) This is a great feature."</b>
