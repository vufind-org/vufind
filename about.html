    <h2>About VuFind®</h2>

    <p>
      VuFind® is a discovery system designed and developed for libraries by libraries, but also suitable for use
      in other types of organizations. The goal of VuFind® is to enable your users to search and browse through all
      of your resources in a single consistent and user-friendly interface. This could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catalog Records</li>
      <li>Digital Library Items</li>
      <li>Institutional Repository Content</li>
      <li>Institutional Bibliography Entries</li>
      <li>Locally Hosted Journal Articles</li>
      <li>Other Library Collections and Resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      VuFind® is completely modular, so you can implement just the basic system, or all of the components. It
      supports building a local index and/or integrating with a variety of subscription services. Since it's open
      source, you can modify or add modules to best fit your needs. A wide range of configurable options allow
      extensive customization without changing any code.
    </p>

    <h2>Power</h2>
    VuFind® runs on Solr Energy. Apache Solr, an open source search engine, offers amazing performance and scalability to allow for VuFind® to respond to search queries in milliseconds time. It has the ability to be distributed if you need to spread the load of the catalog over many servers or in a server farm environment.

    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    VuFind® is offered for free through the GPL open source license. This means that you can use the software for free. You can modify the software and share your successes with the community!

      <b>"I love the 'text this' option in the catalog. It saves paper, I don't have to find the scrap of paper I wrote on, and I don't have to wonder if I transposed the call number. (I just have to have my cell phone with me!) This is a great feature."</b>
