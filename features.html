      <b>Search with Faceted Results</b>
      The search system allows for the user to search from a basic search box
      and then to be able to narrow down the results by clicking on the various facets of the results.

      <b>Live Record Status and Location with Ajax Querying</b>
      The search results page is able to display the live status of a record
      through the use of AJAX by querying the catalog at that exact moment.
      And since it is done through AJAX after the results have loaded, the page will not slow down for any reason.

      <b>"More Like This" Resource Suggestions</b>
      When viewing a record, the user will be offered suggestions of resources that are similar to the current resource.

      <b>Save Resources to Organized Lists</b>
      The user has the ability to save the resources from both the search results page
      and from the record view page to their own customizable lists.
      The lists can be retrieved at any time and will always be there for the user.
      This helps to eliminate the need for desktop based citation management software
      that tends to be too difficult for basic users.
      This makes it simple for all users!

      <b>Browse for Resources</b>
      The user has the ability to browse the catalog allowing them to explore what the library has
      rather than only being able to see a very narrow spectrum of results.

      <b>Zotero Compatible</b>
      Your users can save and tag any records with
      <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> or any other
      <a href="http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> based application so they
      can store their records in one place.

      <b>Internationalization</b>
      The interface has translations available in Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese,
      Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish and many more. And if you
      want to create your own translation - it's easy.  You can even create a new English
      translation if you want to change some of the wording used in the interface -
      it makes the UI that much easier to customize.
