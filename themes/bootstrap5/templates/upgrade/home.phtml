<p>Upgrade complete.  You may still have some work to do:</p>

<ol>
  <?php if ($oldVersion < 2): ?>
    <li>If you have customized your SolrMarc import settings, your marc_local.properties file has been migrated, but you will need to move custom translation maps, index scripts, etc. by hand.  Custom import files belong under <?=$this->escapeHtml($this->importDir)?> -- this will make future upgrades easier.</li>
    <li>You should look over the configuration files in <?=$this->escapeHtml($this->configDir)?> and make sure settings look correct.  The automatic update process sometimes re-enables disabled settings and removes comments.</li>
    <li>If you have customized any of the YAML searchspecs files without using the *_local.yaml override mechanism, you will need to reapply those changes.</li>
    <li>If you have customized code or templates in your previous version, you will need to adapt those changes to the new architecture.</li>
  <?php else: ?>
    <li>You should look over the configuration files in <?=$this->escapeHtml($this->configDir)?> and make sure settings look correct.  The automatic update process sometimes re-enables disabled settings and removes comments.  Backups of your old configurations have been created for comparison purposes.</li>
    <li>If you have customized code or templates in your previous version, you should test them to be sure they still work correctly; see the <a href="https://vufind.org/wiki/changelog">changelog</a> for notes on possible breaks in backward compatibility.</li>
  <?php endif; ?>
  <li>You should reindex all of your content.</li>
  <li>You may want to check for problems on the <a href="<?=$this->url('install-home')?>"><?=$this->transEsc('auto_configure_title')?></a> page.</li>
