      <h2><i class="fa fa-search"></i> Free word search</h2>
      <p>Enter your search terms in the search box. In the drop-down menu at the end of the search box, you can choose to search by title, author or subject.</p>
      <p>Search terms separated by spaces use the AND search logic and will return results containing all of your search terms.<p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <pre class="code">mannerheim carl</pre>
      <p>produces the same search results as</p>
      <pre class="code">mannerheim AND carl</pre>
      <p>After starting your search, you can for example narrow your search results by permissible uses, type of material or date of manufacture.</p>
      <pre class="code">child</pre>
      <p>The search results return material related to children</p>
      <pre class="code">"children"</pre>
      <p>This is a targeted search in which the quotes limit the search results to those that contain the word ”children.”</p>
      <pre class="code">"University of Helsinki"</pre>
      <p>It’s always a good idea to put phrases like these in quotes so that Finna doesn’t interpret your search as separate words</p>
      <pre class="code">children summer</pre>
      <p>This search is the same as entering children AND summer; the search will include all results related to children and summer</p>
      <pre class="code">countryside OR farm</pre>
      <p>The search results will include results related to the countryside or to farms</p>
      <pre class="code">"kivi aleksis"</pre>
      <p>The author’s name should be in quotes, and ideally the last name should be entered first</p>
      <pre class="code">know*</pre>
      <p>The asterisk truncates words so that the search may return results with a number of different endings, e.g. knowledge and know-how</p>
      <p>If, for example, you enter the name of a book in the search box, Finna predicts your search terms by offering results that may allow you to find your book directly.</p>
      <p><strong>You can find more instructions on forming search phrases in  <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'help-syntax'])?>">the Search syntax section</a>.</strong></p>

      <h2>Narrowing your search</h2>
      <p>The search results page displays the best results at the top based on the relevance of the match. You can change the order of the results by, for example, changing the date of manufacture to view from oldest to newest. Additionally you can view the search results as a summary list or in gallery format.</p>
