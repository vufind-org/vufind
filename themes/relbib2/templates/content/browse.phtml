<h1 id="anchor">Browsing</h1>
<p>Next to simple and advanced search RelBib offers three different ways to browse the database: by topic (“Find Topic”),
   according to categories (“Browse by Category”) and alphabetically (“Browse Alphabetically”). You can access this
   function by clicking on “Browse” in the area below the search field.</p>
<h2>Find Topic</h2>
<p>The <a href="<?=$this->url('keywordchainsearch-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse Keywordchains')?></a> mode is intended to find subjects
   and standardized subject groups that are similar to the terms entered. This is especially useful to obtain subject groups and titles
   that are topically close to your originating search.
   You can also switch to this mode from the other way around: Select a specific title which was catalogued with subject headings.
   Just click on the <span class="iconlabel label label-info">B</span> button on the left of the subject heading string, and you will
   see other titles which were catalogued with that string.</p>
<h2>Browse by Category</h2>
<p>The <a href="<?=$this->url('browse-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse by Category')?></a> mode offers a way to start with some high
   level categories and refine your search to certain aspects without the need to know specific search terms beforehand. Categories provided are
   call number (DDC classmarks), RelBib classification, topic (subject heading), author and publisher. You are lead through a tree structure and may
   filter the items you wish to browse by using other fields.</p>
<h2>Browse Alphabetically</h2>
<p>The  <a href="<?=$this->url('alphabrowse-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse Alphabetically')?></a> mode offers a comprehensive
   alphabetically sorted list of the contents of the respective categories. This is advantageous for survey research.
   You can decide at which point in the alphabet you would like to step in and choose from the following aspects:
   by topic, by author, by title or by call number.</p>
<p>This function is also useful when you are not sure how to spell the name of a given author or term: in that case just
   enter the first few letters of a word.</p>
