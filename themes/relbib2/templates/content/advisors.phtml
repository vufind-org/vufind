<h1>FID Advisory Board</h1>
<p>The main task of the FID Advisory Board is to act as a link between the academic community and the FID. For this purpose, there are regular meetings in which (new) work steps of the FID are constructively discussed. The advisory board will take the services already offered by the FID to the academic community and give feedback to the FID from there, so that there is comprehensible clarity about whether and how individual services should be included, expanded in terms of content or restricted in the future.</p>
