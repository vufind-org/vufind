<p>Many useful functions are at your disposal when you create a personal account.</p>
<p>In order to register or log into your account, click on the link called “Login” on the top right corner. By clicking on “Your account”,
   you come into your personalized area.</p>
<p>You may then use the following functions:</p>

<h2>Alerting function</h2>
<p>The alerting function lets you know when new articles from certain journals and new volumes from certain series are available. You may decide
   in which cases you would like to get a corresponding message.</p>
<p>In order to receive alerts for a journal or a series, you first have to select the entry for the journal or series as a whole. You then click on the
   “Bell” symbol <i class="fa fa-fw fa-bell"></i> which you will find on the right side of the corresponding entry. You can manage the list
    of publications marked for an alert in your account under the heading “New Issue Alerting”.</p>
<h2>Saving search requests</h2>
<p>Your current search requests are temporarily stored in the search history. If you would like to have permanent access to certain search
   requests, you can save them permanently in your account. You will find them under “Saved Searches” and may use them again through a simple
   mouse click. This feature might be useful for complex requests or for subjects in which you have a continuing interest. In this way, you will
   find the latest literature on a given subject or area of knowledge. Likewise, you can send your search request to another person via e-mail.</p>
<p>Select the corresponding search tool underneath the list of search results.</p>
<h2>Sending your search result list per e-mail</h2>
<p>You can also send your search result list or single entries to another person per e-mail. Choose individual entries or tick
   “Select Page” above the list. Click the “E-Mail” button and enter the destination address.</p>
<p>Please notice: you can only send the entries of a single result page. The result set can be increased using the “Results per page” drop-down
   menu above the list.</p>
<h2>Saving favorites</h2>
<p>You can save interesting titles directly in your account. Click on the “Star” symbol <i class="fa fa-fw fa-star"></i> in the result list
   or in the detailed view. They are then permanently accessible, and you do not have to waste any time searching for them again.
   You may keep your “favorites” in different lists  which you define yourself. In this way, you can assign interesting titles
   to specific research projects or subjects. In your account, you can also export your favorites, send them per e-mail or print them.</p>
