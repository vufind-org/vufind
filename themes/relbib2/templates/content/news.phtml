<h1 id="06_2019">Research Data in the Study of Religion - Survey</h1>
<p class="rb-news-date">(June 2019)</p>
<p><b>Dear scholars of the study of religion!</b></p>
<p>On 25 February 2019, the advisory board and the team of the FID Study of Religion dealt intensively with the topic of research data and research data management (RDM) in the study of religion.</p>
<p>The reason for this meeting was the currently widely discussed and followed development of a National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which was adopted by the German Joint Science Conference (GWK) in November 2018 by an agreement between the Federal Government and the States.</p>
<p><a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'research_data_management'])?>">Here you can find this agreement and further information on RDM.</a></p>
<p>There are clear signs that the handling of research data will in future play a more prominent role in the scientific work process than in the past: Funding will be allocated on the basis of proven RDM, among other things. The formation of NFDI consortia in which users and providers of research data are to network in cooperation with scientific infrastructure institutions is already in full swing. The specialist associations are expected to actively identify the requirements if their subject is to be taken into account.</p>
<p>The dialogue on research data and the RDM should therefore be brought into the community by the German Association for the Study of Religion (DVRW) as soon as possible. With this survey the FID Study of Religion would like to support the DVRW in this. On the basis of the survey and further discussions, the DVRW can develop a position paper that phrases the needs of the research community vis-à-vis the actors in the NFDI formation process. Depending on the survey results, the FID will examine the extent to which participation in the formation of NFDI consortia is necessary.</p>
<p>We therefore kindly ask you to participate in the survey. The survey consists of 19 questions and will take about <b>10 minutes</b>. It will end on <b>7 July 2019</b>, after which the results will be published on the FID website.</p>
<p><b>With your participation, you will also ensure that the subject of study of religion is not overlooked in its specificity with regard to research data during the development of the technical and infrastructural framework conditions.</b></p>
<p><b>Many thanks!</b></p>
<p>Please note that the survey is only available in German.</p>

<p class="rb-news-date">(March 2019)</p>
<p>At the end of March, a major library project was brought to a successful conclusion: the Göttingen Library Network (GBV) and the Southwest German Library Network (SWB) have been merged. The outcome is a large data pool called <a href="https://wiki.k10plus.de/display/K10PLUS/Allgemeines+zur+Kooperation+BSZ+und+GBV" target="_blank">K10plus</a> which comprises over 180 million data records from libraries in ten federal states.</p>
<p>The advantage for RelBib - many relevant records of libraries from the GBV area (including the SUB Göttingen, but also ULB Halle, TIB etc.), can now be easily tagged with the RelBib mark and thus made available in the bibliography.</p>

<h1 id="01_2019">Further funding of the FID Study of Religion</h1>
<p class="rb-news-date">(January 2019)</p>
<p>Our DFG proposal for further funding of the FID Study of Religion for the next three years was approved with very benevolent votes of the expert jury and we are looking forward to tackling our various tasks and goals with fresh energy in January.</p>
<p>The main tasks for the second funding period (2019-2021) are in brief:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>acquisition</b> of academic literature according to the defined subject profile for the coverage of the peak demand</li>
    <li>
        substantial content expansion of the Open Access bibliography <b>RelBib</b> by
        <ul>
            <li>indexing of articles in <b>collections</b> (conference proceedings, Festschrift etc.)</li>
            <li>inclusion of a larger number of <b>journals</b> in RelBib at the article level.</li>
            <li>retrospective cataloguing of <b>older volumes of journals</b> that are already indexed at the article level</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After a long period of preparation we will finally start the FID <b>self-archiving service</b>. Those authors who responded to our survey last year will successively be contacted by us and asked for their literature lists.</li>
    <li>We are particularly proud and happy to have found <b>cooperation partners</b> with <b>REMID e.V.</b> and the <b>Marburg University Library</b>: The REMID archive collection has been managed by the REMID association so far and now will be permanently transferred to Marburg University Library, where it will be properly indexed in form and content during the next three years. The archive comprises approx. 580 journals, 80 of them current titles, and approx. 800 to 900 thematic folders with brochures and materials. The data will then be migrated to RelBib. Thus, for the first time it will be possible to search for archive material in the bibliography.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="07_2018">Zotero Group: How journal articles get indexed in RelBib</h1>
<p class="rb-news-date">(July 2018)</p>
<p>In RelBib, journals relevant to the study of religion are listed not only as a whole, but also by their individual articles. But how do they get into RelBib? Our staff enter the article metadata (i.e. title, author(s), year of publishing, journal title etc.) into the cataogue of the Southwest German Library Network (SWB). This is very time-consuming and we have only limited personnel capacities. In many cases iti is possible to retrieve the article metadata semi-automatically with the help of the open source software Zotero. However, there are journals where this procedure does not work (so well). In order to be able to include the articles of these journals in RelBib, we have developed a simple procedure for cooperative indexing. Interested editors join our "Zotero Group" and enter the article data we need for RelBib. This is not a difficult task and we will support you in all questions. On our homepage you will find instructions for this procedure under <a href="/docs/ZoteroGroup_Instruction_de.pdf" target="_blank">"RelBib A-Z"</a>.</p>

<h1 id="05_2018">Follow-up application submitted!</h1>
<p class="rb-news-date">(May 2018)</p>
<p>The FID Study of Religion is currently in its last year of DFG funding. For a further funding period of three years (2019-2021), we submitted a follow-up proposal to the DFG on 1 May. Project objectives and work steps for the new funding period have been drafted in close consultation with the new FID advisory board, which represents the interests of the academic community.</p>

<h1 id="03_2018">Academic Advisory Board of the FID Study of Religion</h1>
<p class="rb-news-date">(March 2018)</p>
<p>In January 2018, an advisory board for the FID Study of Religion was founded, consisting of five representatives of the subject. The advisory board met for the first time on 21st March 2018 in Tübingen.</p>
<p>The main task of the advisory board is to act as a link between the scholars of religion and the FID. There are regular meetings at which (new) steps in the work of the FID are to be discussed constructively. The advisory board will transfer the FID services already offered to the scientific community and give feedback to the FID from there, so that there is comprehensible clarity as to whether and how individual services should be expanded or restricted in future.</p>
<p>Current members of the FID advisory board are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prof. Dr. Gritt Klinkhammer (University of Bremen / chairwoman of the DVRW)</li>
    <li>Prof. Dr. Monika Schrimpf (University of Tübingen)</li>
    <li>Prof. Dr. Horst Junginger (University of Leipzig)</li>
    <li>Dr. Martin Radermacher (CERES Bochum)</li>
    <li>Moritz Klenk (Universitäten Bern / Bonn).</li>
</ul>
