<h1 id="anchor">Subject headings</h1>
<p>Subject headings are standardized terms that are intellectually added to books and journal articles in order to outline the content of a work and thus ensure a better retrievability in subject searching.</p>
<p>In addition to the thematic subject headings (subject / keyword), there are subject headings referring to the form, to the period or the region covered.</p>

<p>In Relbib there are different possibilities to use subject headings for a search:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Selection of the field "Subject" next to the search slot</li>
    <li>Browsing by Subject</li>
    <li>Filtering a set of search results with the help of the keyword facets in the right column</li>
</ul>

<p><i>By the way</i>: The subject headings in RelBib have been translated into English, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese. This means that searching for a term always leads to the same number of results whichever of these languages is set.</p>
<p>Example: A search for the keyword "atheism" results in the same number of results as a search for "Atheismus".</p>
