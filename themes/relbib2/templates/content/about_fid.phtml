        <h3>Acquisition of literature on the study of religion <b>:: Monographic Literature</b></h3>
        <p>The FID acquires monographs and collected works from Germany and abroad according to a profile agreed with the specialist community. The profile primarily comprises literature on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Theory, methodology, history and comparison of religions</li>
            <li>
                Religions in the international and global context, especially New Religious Movements.<br/>
                <i>Please note:</i> Literature on individual non-Christian religions is collected in the respective Regional Studies’ FID, e.g. FID "Near and Middle East, Islamic Studies"; FID CrossAsia; FID Jewish Studies and is therefore acquired by FID Religious Studies only by exception.
            </li>
            <li>Spiritual movements of any kind: pseudo-, anti-, non-religions; atheism and ‘Religionskritik’.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pro-active and patron-driven acquisition</h4>
        <p>In addition to the pro-active acquisition by the subject specialist, there are two components of a user-controlled acquisition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By a PDA component included in <b>RelBib</b>, the Bibliography of the study of religion, users can trigger acquisitions of titles that are indexed but so far not accessible anywhere in Germany.</li>
            <li>In addition, there is the possibility of proposing titles of any format of interest to the study of religion, which are not (yet) listed in RelBib and therefore cannot be ordered via the PDA function mentioned above.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these three strategic acquisition components, FID Religionswissenschaft hopes to meet the demand for a comprehensive information and supply of literature in the field of the study of religion.</p>


        <h3>Acquisition of Study of Religion Literature <b>:: Journals</b></h3>
        <p>A definition of what exactly a “Study of Religion journal” is or, providing a list of journals relevant to the study of religion proves to be extremely difficult. The answer may vary between individual academics depending on their specialization.</p>
        <p>The ‘FID Study of Religion’ has currently subscribed to or licensed 193 journals, some of which are also included in interdisciplinary 'packages'. Many of the journals have already been held at the library as part of the former SSG programme. Approximately 20 journals are owned exclusively by Tübingen university library.</p>
        <p>Considering the varying specialization possible in the field of the study of religion, it becomes clear that there are important journals which may belong to neighbouring subjects, such as journals on individual religions, also Christianity, journals in the social, cultural and regional sciences, history and many other subjects even up to medicine and natural sciences.</p>
        <p>Bearing this in mind, it becomes clear that in addition to a well-founded acquisition profile, the indexing of relevant (journal) literature in the field of the study of religion plays an important, if not the most important, role.</p>


        <h4>RelBib – Bibliography of the Study of Religion and more</h4>
        <p>The focus of the ‘FID Study of Religion’ lies on the <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'about_relbib'])?>">reation, continuation and improvement of <b>RelBib</b></a>. This comprehensive bibliography of literature relevant to the study of religion was released on 24 July 2017 in an alpha version and has been published in June 2019 in the current portal environment, in which all information and services for the study of religion community are offered under one interface.</p>

        <h3>Enhancement by adding more articles on the study of religion</h3>
        <h4>Project "Articles in Collective works"</h4>
        <p>With the beginning of the second project phase 2019-2021, the ‘FID Study of Religion’ has started to identify the numerous articles that are hidden in collections of essays (i.e.: anthologies, festschrifts, congress volumes, etc.) and is going to index them in Relbib. The better retrieval of such contributions is an urgent desideratum by the study of religion community.</p>

        <h4>Project "Retro Cataloguing"</h4>
        <p>Another request from study of religion scholars was to index older articles from relevant journals. Some 40 journals will be retro-catalogued with the help of semi-automatic metadata acquisition and, as far as possible, subject indexed.</p>

        <h3>Strengthening Open Access activities</h3>
        <h4>Self archiving service</h4>
        <p>The ‘FID Study of Religion’ supports the publication and accessibility of literature in its discipline by operating a specialist repository for <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'self_archiving_service'])?>">self archiving publications</a>.</p>

        <h5>Open Journal Platform</h5>
        <p>We help publishers of journals and series who wish to offer their journal open access on how to set up or switch to the <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'ojs'])?>">OJS platform.</a></p>

        <h4>Information on research data management</h4>
        <p>The discourse on the handling of <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'research_data_management'])?>">research data</a> plays an important role in an increasingly digital research world. The FID supports scholars of the study of religion for any questions they may have on the subject.</p>


        <h3>Collaborations</h3>
        <p>With the help of cooperations, the ‘FID Study of Religion’ seeks to improve its services. In the context of a continuous expansion of the RelBib database, cooperation with editorial teams of journals is sought for, as well as cooperations with institutions.</p>

        <h3><a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'cooperative_cataloguing'])?>">Cooperative cataloguing</a> with editorial teams</h3>
        <p>Editorial teams or interested academics can use a script of the Open Access Software Zotero to index their journal's articles themselves and submit them to RelBib.</p>

        <h3>Project: Indexing of the REMID archive</h3>
        <p>With the start of the second funding phase (2018-2021), the Institute for Comparative Studies in Culture and Religion at the University of Marburg, REMID e.V. and the University Library of Marburg could be won as <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'cooperations_institutions'])?>">cooperation partners</a>. The aim of the Marburg subproject is to make the REMID e.V. archive accessible.</p>

        <h3>Cooperation with other FIDs</h3>
        <p>On an informal level we cooperate with the <a target="_blank" href="//crossasia.org">FID CrossAsia</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="//bibliothek.uni-halle.de/projekte/fid_nahost/">FID Middle East, North Africa and Islamic Studies</a>.</p>

            History of the Study of Religion collection at the University Library of Tübingen
        </a>
    </div>
    <div id="history" class="collapse tf-panel-collapse-body">
        <p>Religious studies began to establish itself as an independent discipline in the 19th century. Before this, relevant questions had been dealt with within the framework of systematic theology and missionary studies on the one hand, and in ethnology and literary studies, especially Oriental studies, on the other hand.</p>
        <p>In Tübingen, the Indologist and Orientalist Rudolf von Roth (1821-1895) regularly gave lectures on the history of religion. He also was director of the university library and thus ensured the development of a collection of fundamental works on non-Christian religions, with a focus on the religions of Asia.</p>
        <p>Today, the study of religion is of increased importance due to religious pluralization and other social developments. In its "Empfehlungen zur Weiterentwicklung von Theologien und religionsbezogenen Wissenschaften an deutschen Hochschulen" (Recommendations for the Further Development of Theologies and Religion-Related Sciences at German Universities) (Drs. 9678-10, Berlin, 29 January 2010), the Council of Science and Humanities explains: <i>"Die Besonderheit der Religionswissenschaft liegt weniger in ihrer Methodik oder in der Exklusivität ihres Gegenstandes 'Religion' als vielmehr in ihrem systematischen Anspruch sowie in ihrer komparativen Perspektive, mit der sie empirisch und theoretisch-systematisch religiöse Phänomene innerhalb und außerhalb moderner westlicher Gesellschaften erforscht."</i> (The peculiarity of religious studies lies less in its methodology or in the exclusivity of its subject 'religion' than rather in its systematic claim as well as in its comparative perspective, with which it empirically and theoretically-systematically researches religious phenomena within and outside of modern Western societies"). (ibid. p. 87)</p>
        <p>The special subject collection 'SSG General and Comparative Religious Studies' has been managed by the University Library of Tübingen since 1981. It was previously the responsibility of the University Library of Marburg and there is still a <a target="_blank" href="//www.uni-marburg.de/de/ub/recherchieren/bestaende/sammlungen/religionswissenschaft-2">collection focus for the study of religion</a>.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to quantify the older holdings of literature of the study of religion, since in earlier times it was recorded statistically under theology or under oriental subjects.</p>
        <p>Since the subject has been maintained as a separate DFG special subject collection at the Tübingen University Library, the holdings of literature on the study of religion has grown from about 250 volumes at the beginning (1981) to about 600 volumes annually. It should be noted here that titles that deal with one or more of the Asian and Oriental religions (Islam; Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, etc.) were collected in their respective regional special collections and are not included in the count of the 'SSG General and Comparative Religious Studies'. That means that the holdings relevant to the study of religion are probably many times higher.</p>
