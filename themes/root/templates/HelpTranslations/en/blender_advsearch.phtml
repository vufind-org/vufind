    <p>When you first visit the Advanced Search page, you are presented with
       several search fields.  In each field, you can type the keywords you
       want to search for.  <a href="<?=$this->url('help', ['topic' => 'blender'])?>">Search operators</a>
       are allowed.</p>
    <p>Each field is accompanied by a drop-down that lets you specify the type
       of data (title, author, etc.) you are searching for.  You can mix and
       match search types however you like.</p>
    <p>Results must match every search field.</p>
    <p>The "Add Search Field" button may be used to add additional search fields
       to the form.  You may use as many search fields as you wish.</p>
