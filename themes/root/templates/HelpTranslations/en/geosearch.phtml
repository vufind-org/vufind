    <h3>Interacting with the search results</h3>
    <p>Search results are displayed on the map as clusters (circular icons with numbers). The numbers represent
        the number of records in each cluster. A list of results is displayed below the map view. </p>
    <p>You can interact with the map by zooming by either using the zoom buttons (+/-) or by using the mouse to
        double-click (zoom in) or shift + double-click (zoom out).</p>
    <p>Clusters with less than 5 records will display pop-up information about the records at that location.
        When you hover over a cluster with less than 5 records, the mouse pointer will change to a hand with a finger
        pointing at the cluster. Click on the cluster, and a pop-up window will appear showing a list of titles for the
        records at that location. Each title is hyperlinked to the associated record.
        Click on the title to view the full record.</p>
