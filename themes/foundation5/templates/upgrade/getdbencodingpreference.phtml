<p>Your current VuFind database is encoded in Latin-1 format.  This may cause incorrect sorting and
display of records containing characters outside of the basic ASCII character set.</p>

<p>It is <b>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</b> that you convert your database to UTF-8.  However, this will
prevent older versions of VuFind from reading the database correctly.</p>

<p>If you need to maintain backward compatibility with 1.x, choose "Keep."  You can return to this
upgrade tool later to perform UTF-8 conversion.</p>

<p>If backward compatibility is not necessary, choose "Change" now.
(You should make a backup first if you have not already!)</p>
