; oai.ini -- OAI-PMH harvest settings.
;
; For every OAI-PMH source you would like to harvest, create a section like this:
;
; [section_name]
; url = http://oai.myuniversity.edu/
; set = my_optional_set
; metadataPrefix = oai_dc
; timeout = 60
; combineRecords = false
; combineRecordsTag = <collection>
; idSearch[] = "/oai:myuniversity.edu:/"
; idReplace[] = "myprefix-"
; injectDate = false
; injectId = false
; injectSetName = false
; injectSetSpec = false
; injectHeaderElements[] = hierarchy
; dateGranularity = auto
; harvestedIdLog = harvest.log
; verbose = false
; autosslca = true
; sslcapath = "/etc/ssl/certs" ; e.g. for Debian systems
; sslcafile = "/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem" ; e.g. for CentOS systems
; sslverifypeer = true
; sanitize = true
; sanitizeRegex[] = "/[^\x{0009}\x{000a}\x{000d}\x{0020}-\x{D7FF}\x{E000}-\x{FFFD}]+/u"
; badXMLLog = bad.log
; httpUser = myUsername
; httpPass = myPassword
;
; The section_name may be passed to harvest_oai.php as a parameter to harvest only
; records from that source.  This is also the directory name that records will be
; harvested into (a subdirectory of "harvest" under VUFIND_HOME).
;
; url is the base URL for the OAI-PMH source.
;
; set is the identifier of a set to harvest (normally found in the <setSpec> tag of
; an OAI-PMH ListSets response).  You may harvest multiple sets by putting multiple
; "set[] = x" lines into your configuration.  Omit set to harvest all records.
;
; metadataPrefix is the metadata format to harvest (oai_dc will be used by default
; if the value is omitted).
;
; timeout may be set to the number of seconds to allow for an OAI request (a value
; of 60 will be used by default).
;
; combineRecords may be set to true if you would like the harvested records to be
; combined into a fewer number of files (this is determined by the OAI server's
; response chunk size). The default setting (false) will result in a new file being
; created for each record. Note that this function is primarily intended for
; harvesting MARC records; many of VuFind's example XSLT transformations for other
; types of metadata are designed to process one record at a time and will not
; work with this setting. However, it is possible to revise the XSLT to handle
; batches of records. Starting with VuFind 6.0, a demo .xsl for OJS that can handle
; combined records within a <collection> tag has been included as an example
; and can be found at $VUFIND_HOME/import/xsl/ojs-multirecord.xsl.
;
; combineRecordsTag may be used to supply a beginning and ending XML tag (if
; combinedRecords is set to true) which will be used to wrap the set of
; combined records. The default value is <collection>. Note: you may also add
; attributes to this tag, e.g., <collection attr="value"> will correctly
; wrap the records in <collection attr="value"></collection> tags.
;
; globalSearch[] and globalReplace[] may be used to manipulate the raw XML metadata
; documents with regular expressions. This should be used with caution but can be
; helpful when compensating for server-side encoding/markup errors. You may use
; multiple pairs of search and replace settings to perform multiple manipulations.
;
; idPrefix is the OAI-specific prefix attached to ID values.  If you provide the
; value here, it will be automatically stripped for you when generating filenames,
; injecting IDs and tracking deleted records.  If you omit the setting, full
; OAI ids will be retained. [DEPRECATED -- use idSearch and idReplace instead]
;
; idSearch[] and idReplace[] may be used to manipulate IDs with regular expressions.
; This is useful for adding or removing prefixes and swapping out problematic
; characters.  You may use multiple pairs of search and replace settings to perform
; multiple manipulations.
;
; injectDate may be set to an XML tag name in order to inject the datestamp of
; the record into the harvested metadata (enclosed in the specified tag).  If
; omitted or set to false, no datestamp-related changes will be made to the
; harvested metadata.
;
; injectId may be set to an XML tag name in order to inject the ID of the record
; into the harvested metadata (enclosed in the specified tag).  If omitted or set
; to false, no ID-related changes will be made to the harvested metadata.
;
; injectSetName may be set to an XML tag name in order to inject the setName value
; of the record into the harvested metadata (enclosed in the specified tag).  If
; omitted or set to false, no setName-related changes will be made to the harvested
; metadata.
;
; injectSetSpec may be set to an XML tag name in order to inject the setSpec value
; of the record into the harvested metadata (enclosed in the specified tag).  If
; omitted or set to false, no setSpec-related changes will be made to the harvested
; metadata.
;
; injectHeaderElements may be set to an array of elements within the header of the
; OAI-PMH response which should be copied into the saved XML document.  This is
; rarely necessary.
;
; dateGranularity is the granularity used by the server for representing dates.
; This may be "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ," "YYYY-MM-DD" or "auto" (to query the server
; for details).  The default is "auto."
;
; harvestedIdLog is a filename (inside your harvest directory) for a text file
; listing all non-deleted harvested records encountered.  If you omit this setting,
; no log file will be generated.  Subsequent harvests will append to the file if
; it already exists.
;
; verbose may be set to true in order to display more detailed output while
; harvesting; this may be useful for troubleshooting purposes, but it defaults to
; false.
;
; autosslca will attempt to autodetect your SSL certificate authority.
;
; sslcafile can be used to specify the path to an SSL certificate authority
; file (e.g. /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem on CentOS/RedHat systems).
;
; sslcapath can be used to specify the path to an SSL certificate authority
; directory (e.g. /etc/ssl/certs on Debian systems).
;
; sslverifypeer may be set to false to disable SSL certificate checking; it defaults
; to true, and changing the setting is not recommended.
;
; sanitize may be set to true to strip illegal characters from XML responses; it
; defaults to false, assuming that the OAI-PMH server you are harvesting from will
; provide you with valid data.
; 
; sanitizeRegex may be set to an array of regex strings used to sanitize XML retrieved
; from an OAI-PMH source. Any text sequences matching these expressions will be 
; replaced with blank spaces.
;
; badXMLLog may be set to a filename (which will be created within your harvest
; directory) to contain copies of bad XML that was fixed when the sanitize setting
; (above) is set to true.
;
; httpUser is an optional username in case the OAI repository is behind HTTP basic
; authentication.  It must be set in combination with httpPass.
;
; httpPass is an optional password in case the OAI repository is behind HTTP basic
; authentication.  It must be set in combination with httpUser.
