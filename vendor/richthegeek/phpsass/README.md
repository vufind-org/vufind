#IMPORTANT NOTICE
We will soon be implementing PSR standards, and so compatibility requirements will move to PHP 5.3. A separate branch will be made for older versions, although it may not be updated.

## Try online
You can compile and compare SCSS against the ruby compiler at <http://phpsass.com/try>

## About
This is fork of phamlp primarily for inclusiong as a Drupal pre-processor.
However, there is no Drupal-specific code and it will work for any PHP system.

This version of the compiler is NOT compatible with other forks of PHamlP, and
the name has been changed to reflect this. Please take a look at the "sassy"
module on Drupal.org for information on how to add frameworks and custom
functions. Docs will be coming when we aren't doing more important things.
