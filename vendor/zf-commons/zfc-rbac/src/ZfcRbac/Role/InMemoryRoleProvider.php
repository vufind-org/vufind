/**
 * Simple role providers that store them in memory (ideal for small websites)
 *
 * This provider expects role to be specified using string only. The format is as follow:
 *
 *  [
 *      'myRole' => [
 *          'children'    => ['subRole1', 'subRole2'], // OPTIONAL
 *          'permissions' => ['permission1'] // OPTIONAL
 *      ]
 *  ]
 *
 * For maximum performance, this provider DOES NOT do a lot of type check, so you must closely
 * follow the format :)
