/**
 * Interface that each guard must implement
 *
 * A guard is a lightweight security layer that occurs typically after the route has been matched. ZfcRbac
 * provides built-in implementations that can guard your routes and/or controllers.
 *
 * A guard can be used to block, for instance, a whole route hierarchy (all admin routes). However, only
 * using guards is not sufficient and rather limited, and you should protected your services using the
 * proper authorization service (see the doc for more details)
