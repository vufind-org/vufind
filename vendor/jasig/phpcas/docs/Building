### Build process for phpCAS package ###
########################################

1. Prepare your own build config:

go to the utils/ dir and copy build-example.properties to a
build.properties file and adjust the path for all needed binaries. You need
at least php and doxygen for package creation. Git is needed as a developer with
commit priviledges and upload right for the distribution package.

2. Install necessary php packages:

Install the pear package PEAR_PackageFileManager2 via the command

"pear install PEAR_PackageFileManager2"


3. Run the "ant" tasks to build the phpCAS package and other developer tasks:

ant dist      # create a local package
ant clean     # clear local packages and temporary files
ant prepare   # The default action, tags, packages, and commits to the local git repository
ant push      # Push the new commits and tags to the origin repository (github)
ant upload    # Upload to jasig
ant makeCurrentSymlink # Set the symbolic link on the jasig site for the most current packages
ant revert    # To revert any "ant prepare" actions before they are pushed to the github repo

The ant prepare target is equivalent to ant tag && ant dist && ant markdev.

To revert the commits and tag additions added in the ant tag and ant markdev
targets, use the new ant revert target. This should not be done after pushing.
Running ant prepare is safe and can be followed by ant revert to get rid of the
added commits and tag in your local repository.
