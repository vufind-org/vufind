<h1>System Requirements</h1><p>Apache Solr runs of Java 7 or greater, Java 8 is verified to be compatible and may bring some performance improvements. When using Oracle Java 7 or OpenJDK 7, be sure to not use the GA build 147 or update versions u40, u45 and u51! We recommend using u55 or later.</p><p>It is also recommended to always use the latest update version of your Java VM, because bugs may affect Solr. An overview of known JVM bugs can be found on <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs">http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs</a></p><p>With all Java versions it is strongly recommended to not use experimental <code>-XX</code> JVM options.</p><p>CPU, disk and memory requirements are based on the many choices made in implementing Solr (document size, number of documents, and number of hits retrieved to name a few). The benchmarks page has some information related to performance on particular platforms. </p>
