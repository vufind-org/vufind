# Uncomment the following settings to insert appropriate values for your site:
#collection = "Catalog"
#institution = "MyInstitution"
#building = "Library A"

# Uncomment the following lines to track history of indexing times for RSS feeds,
# OAI-PMH server and other updates.  The parameter to these functions must be the
# same fieldspec as the id setting above!
# IMPORTANT: Indexing this extra information will make extra database calls during
#            the indexing process and will likely slow things down significantly.
#first_indexed = custom, getFirstIndexed(001)
#last_indexed = custom, getLastIndexed(001)

# Uncomment the following line to index full text from URLs found in your MARC
# records.  All sorts of document formats are supported (PDF, Word Doc, ASCII
# text, HTML, etc.) The first parameter is a fieldspec showing which fields to use
# for URL retrieval.  The second parameter is optional -- if included, only files
# matching the specified suffix will be indexed.  Note that this functionality
# depends on a full text tool being installed on your system.  See the wiki for
# details:
#       https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:full_text_tools

# Uncomment the following if you want to use the OpenLayers3 Geographic Search
# and OpenLayers3 Geo-Display functionality
# See searches.ini for configuration options for Geographic Searching.
# See config.ini for configuration options for Geo-Display.

# Uncomment the following lines if you are indexing journal article data that uses
# the 773 field to describe the journal containing the article.  These settings
# assume the records have been formatted according to recommendation 4.1 found at:
#     http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2003/2003-dp01.html
# If you have records using a different 773 format, you may need to write a custom
# indexing script to parse out volume/issue/number.
# Additionally, you will need to make sure articles have a format value of "Article."
# If all of your records are articles, you can hard-code this using:
#format = "Article"
# ...but if you need to distinguish between articles and non-articles, you will need
# to build a custom getFormat routine.

# determination in place of the default "multiple formats" approach.

# Uncomment the following lines to use a hierarchical facet for formats. Note that
# the facet needs to be set hierarchical also in facets.ini like this:
#   [SpecialFacets]
#   hierarchical[] = format
# Note also that if you need to customize the mappings, you will have to modify them
# for all the levels used.
