# Uncomment the following settings to insert appropriate values for your site:
#collection = "Catalog"
#institution = "MyInstitution"

# VuFind stores MARC records in JSON format, but you can instead choose either
# binary or XML format by uncommenting one of the lines below. Using binary MARC
# is not recommended if you have any records which exceed the 99,999 byte limit
# imposed by that encoding.
#fullrecord = FullRecordAsMarc

# Uncomment the following lines to track history of indexing times for RSS feeds,
# OAI-PMH server and other updates. The first parameter to these functions must
# be the same fieldspec as the id setting above! You can optionally provide your
# Solr index name as the second parameter if you are using a value other than the
# default of "biblio".
# IMPORTANT: Indexing this extra information will make extra database calls during
#            the indexing process and will likely slow things down significantly.

# Uncomment the following line to index full text from URLs found in your MARC
# records.  All sorts of document formats are supported (PDF, Word Doc, ASCII
# text, HTML, etc.) The first parameter is a fieldspec showing which fields to use
# for URL retrieval.  The second parameter is optional -- if included, only files
# matching the specified suffix will be indexed.  Note that this functionality
# depends on a full text tool being installed on your system.  See the wiki for
# details:

# Uncomment the following lines if you are indexing journal article data that uses

# assume the records have been formatted according to recommendation 4.1 found at:
#     http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2003/2003-dp01.html
# If you have records using a different 773 format, you may need to write a custom
# indexing script to parse out volume/issue/number.
# Additionally, you will need to make sure articles have a format value of "Article."
# If all of your records are articles, you can hard-code this using:
#format = "Article"
# ...but if you need to distinguish between articles and non-articles, you will need
# to build a custom getFormat routine.

# Uncomment the following lines to use a hierarchical facet for formats. Note that
# the facet needs to be set hierarchical also in facets.ini like this:
#   [SpecialFacets]

# Note also that if you need to customize the mappings, you will have to modify them
# for all the levels used.

# Uncomment and modify the following line to customize the creation of work keys
# used to identify different record versions. The example below includes the
# Finnish/Swedish characters in the list of characters to keep.
#
# Parameters:
#   uniform title fields (field spec)
#       Note: This field specification is for generating uniform title keys;
#       its fields will be used solo, not combined to make author/title keys.
#   title fields (field spec)
#   title fields with non-filing characters removed (field spec)
#       Note: The two "title fields" specifications above are for regular title fields
#       like 240 and will be used to generate combined author/title keys.
#   author fields (field spec)
#   characters to include (regex)
#   characters to exclude (regex)
