; below.
default_sort         = relevance

; should be one of the options present in the [Views] section below.

; This section controls the result limit options for search results. default_limit
; sets the default number of results per page. limit_options is a comma-separated
; list of numbers to be presented to the end-user. If only one limit is required,

; This setting allows to limit pagination of a search result as deep pagination
; costs a lot of performance and most users are not very likely to navigate

; This is especially useful to prevent webcrawlers from descending too deep and
; eating up search backend performance. Default is set to unlimited.

; value.  Values on the right of the equal sign are text that will be run

;
; Note: "year", "author" and "title" are special shortcut aliases for the

; This section controls the "New Items" search.
[NewItem]
; New item information can be retrieved from Solr or from the ILS; this setting
; controls which mechanism is used. If using Solr, change tracking must be enabled
; (see https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:tracking_record_changes). If using the ILS,
; your driver must support the getNewItems() method.
; Valid options: ils, solr; default: ils
method = ils
; Comma-separated list of date ranges to offer to the user (i.e. 1,5,30 = one day
; old, or five days old, or thirty days old). If using the "ils" method, be careful
; about raising the maximum age too high -- searching very long date ranges may put
; a load on your ILS.
ranges = 1,5,30
; This setting only applies when using the "ils" method. It controls the maximum
; number of pages of results that will show up when doing a new item search.
; It is necessary to limit the number of results to avoid getting a "too many boolean
; clauses" error from the Solr index (see notes at
; https://vufind.org/jira/browse/VUFIND-128 for more details).  However, if you
; set the value too low, you may get the same results no matter which range setting
; is selected!
result_pages = 10
; This setting can be used to automatically apply filter queries to the New Item
; results.  For example, you might want to filter out certain content types.  You
; can add multiple filters by repeating the "filter[] =" line, or you can skip
; filtering entirely by leaving the line commented out.
; filter[] = "format:Book"

; This section controls RSS feed behavior
[RSS]
; If set, this setting will override sort settings associated with RSS feeds.  This
; allows you to ensure that newly added or changed items in your index appear at
; the top of the feed.  Use "first_indexed desc" if you only want newly-added items
; to be listed first.  Use "last_indexed desc" if you want newly-added-or-changed
; items.  Comment out the whole setting if you do not want custom RSS sorting.
; IMPORTANT: In order for first_indexed and last_indexed sorting to work properly,
;            you need to index record change dates; see the Wiki page at
;            https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:tracking_record_changes
sort = "last_indexed desc"

; The following two sections control the behavior of the autocomplete drop-downs
; associated with search boxes.  The [Autocomplete] section contains global default
; settings, while the [Autocomplete_Types] section allows you to associate different
; autocomplete handlers with different search handlers.
;
; The available autocomplete handlers are:
;
; None
;       Do not provide any suggestions.  You should use this handler if you want to
;       disable suggestions for one search type while still providing suggestions
;       for other search types.  To disable suggestions completely, it is better to
;       use the "enabled" setting in the [Autocomplete] section.
; SolrAuth:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       See Solr below -- this handler behaves exactly the same, except
;       it uses the Solr authority data index rather than the bibliographic index,
;       and its default [Display Field] value is "heading".
; Solr:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       Perform a wildcarded search against [Search Handler], using the contents of
;       [Display Field] (a comma-separated, priority-ordered field list) as
;       suggestions and sorting by [Sort Field].  Any additional parameters at the
;       end of the string are treated as an alternating sequence of field names and
;       values for use as filters against the suggestion list.  All parameters are
;       optional.  If omitted, [Search Handler] will use the default Solr field,
;       [Display Field] will use "title", [Sort Field] will use relevance and no
;       filters will be applied.
; SolrCN
;       A customized version of Solr designed for smart handling of
;       call numbers using the custom CallNumber search handler.
; Tag
;       Provide suggestions from the local database of tags.
;
; You can build your own autocomplete modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/development:plugins:autosuggesters

; Set this to false to disable all autocomplete behavior
enabled = true
; This handler will be used for all search types not covered by [Autocomplete_Types]

; To use sharding, simply fill in lines using the format:

;[IndexShards]
;Library Catalog = localhost:8080/solr/biblio

; This section allows you to set preferences for shards display.  You only need to

; select which shard(s) to search (default if commented out = false)
;showCheckboxes = true
; These lines determine which shards are searched by default if the user hasn't
; specified preferences using checkboxes (default if commented out = all shards):

;defaultChecked[] = "Website"

; Fields must be stripped if you have a field in your main index which is missing
; from any index includable by shards.  This section can be ignored if you are

; This section controls what happens when a record title in a search result list
; is clicked. VuFind can either embed the full result directly in the list using
; AJAX or can display it at its own separate URL as a full HTML page.
; full - separate page (default)
; tabs - embedded using tabs (see record/ajaxview-tabs.phtml)
; accordion - embedded using an accordion (see record/ajaxview-accordion.phtml)
; NOTE: This feature is incompatible with SyndeticsPlus content; please use
;       regular Syndetics if necessary.

; This section allows for adding hidden filters. Each filter will be translated
; to format 'key:"value"' and added by Solr.php as a hidden filter (a facet that
; is always applied but is not seen by the user).  This is useful if you use a
; shared Solr index and need to display different subsets in different contexts
; (for example, a union catalog with separate VuFind instances each member).
[HiddenFilters]
;institution = "MyInstitution"

; This section is an alternative to [HiddenFilters] when you need to create more
; advanced types of filters -- i.e. complex boolean queries.  Keys are ignored,
; but increasing numeric values (1, 2, 3...) are recommended.  Values are fully-
; formed filter queries.
[RawHiddenFilters]

; This section can get used to define conditional filters, i.e. filters
; that are applied under certain conditions.
; You can use a permission set as condition, which has to be defined in
; permissions.ini.
; Keys are ignored, but increasing numeric values (1, 2, 3...) are recommended.
; Values need to be formatted using this schema:
; [-]permission|filter-query
; Prefixing the condition with a minus (-) means that the filter is applied
; when the condition does not match (the permission is not granted).
; The filter may be any filter query valid for Solr.
; Examples:
; -conditionalFilter.MyUniversity|format:Book
; apply filter "format:Book" if permission conditionalFilter.MyUniversity
; (from permissions.ini) is not granted
; conditionalFilter.MyUniversity|format:Article
; apply filter "format:Article" if permission conditionalFilter.MyUniversity
; (from permissions.ini) is granted

; To enable this feature, uncomment the default_top_recommend[] = MapSelection

; for this feature, adjust the parameters in the geofeatures.ini file.

; These configuration settings have been superseded by the geofeatures.ini file.

; Boolean value indicating whether the newer MoreLikeThis query handler should be

; methods may differ.
;useMoreLikeThisHandler = true
; If the MoreLikeThis handler is used, this setting can be used to adjust its

; checkboxes - displays a list of checkbox facets as specified in the

;      with colon-separated parameters following the checkboxes setting; e.g.

;      filters contain values that are illegal in configuration keys -- e.g. []).
; daterange - for the range controls specified by the dateRange setting under
;      [Special_Facets] above; if multiple fields are specified above but you
;      only want certain ones on the advanced screen, you can filter with a
;      colon separated list; e.g. "daterange:field1:field2:field3"
